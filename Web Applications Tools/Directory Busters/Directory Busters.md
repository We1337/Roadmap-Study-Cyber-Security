Directory Busters is a term that refers to software tools or scripts used for discovering hidden directories or files on a web server. The term is often associated with web application security testing and ethical hacking.

These tools work by using a brute-force technique to guess the names of directories or files that may be present on the web server but not linked or visible from the main website. They may also use a dictionary of common directory and file names to guess at likely locations.

Some popular directory busters include:

1. DirBuster: A Java-based tool that uses a dictionary of common directory and file names to discover hidden files and directories on a web server.
2. Gobuster: A command-line tool that can be used to brute-force directories and files on a web server using a wordlist or a custom set of characters.
3. Dirsearch: A Python-based tool that can brute-force directories and files on a web server using a dictionary of common directory and file names.

While these tools can be useful for security testing and identifying potential vulnerabilities, it is important to use them ethically and with permission. Using them on a web server without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences.
