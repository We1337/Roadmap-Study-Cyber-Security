Here are some commonly used web application hacking tools:

1. Burp Suite: A powerful tool for web application security testing, including intercepting and modifying HTTP requests, fuzzing, and testing for common vulnerabilities.
2. Metasploit: A widely used tool for testing the security of web applications, network systems, and servers. It includes a database of known vulnerabilities that can be used to test against the target.
3. OWASP ZAP: An open-source web application security scanner that can detect common vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and more.
4. Nmap: A network scanning tool that can be used to discover open ports and services on the target web application, which can help identify potential vulnerabilities.
5. Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer that can capture and analyze network traffic, including HTTP requests and responses.
6. SQLMap: A tool designed for testing SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases.

It is important to note that these tools should only be used with the appropriate permissions and with the intention of improving the security of web applications. It is illegal and unethical to use them to harm or exploit web applications.
