WPScan is a command-line tool that is used for scanning WordPress installations for vulnerabilities. It is written in Ruby and is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

WPScan works by performing various types of tests on a WordPress website, including:

1. Enumerating WordPress usernames: WPScan can enumerate the usernames of the WordPress users on the target website.
2. Enumerating installed WordPress plugins and themes: WPScan can identify the plugins and themes installed on the target WordPress website.
3. Brute-forcing passwords: WPScan can brute-force passwords for WordPress users by trying different password combinations.
4. Vulnerability scanning: WPScan can scan for known vulnerabilities in the WordPress core, plugins, and themes.
5. WordPress version detection: WPScan can detect the version of WordPress installed on the target website.

WPScan also has a feature to help you to enumerate users, plugins, and themes from a remote WordPress website. This feature can be used for reconnaissance purposes, as well as identifying potential vulnerabilities.

While WPScan can be a useful tool for WordPress security testing and identifying potential vulnerabilities, it is important to use it ethically and with permission. Using it on a WordPress website without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences.
