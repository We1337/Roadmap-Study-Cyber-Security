CMSmap is an open-source python-based tool used for detecting vulnerabilities in popular content management systems (CMS) such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and more. It is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

CMSmap works by scanning a website to determine the CMS it is using and then testing it for known vulnerabilities. Some of the key features of CMSmap include:

1. Automatic CMS detection: CMSmap can automatically detect the CMS being used by a website.
2. Vulnerability scanning: CMSmap can scan for known vulnerabilities in popular CMSes.
3. Bruteforcing: CMSmap can perform brute-force attacks against login pages of popular CMSes to discover weak credentials.
4. Plugin and theme detection: CMSmap can identify installed plugins and themes of the popular CMSes.
5. Version detection: CMSmap can detect the version of the installed CMS.
6. Exploitation: CMSmap can exploit some of the vulnerabilities found in popular CMSes.

CMSmap can be a useful tool for identifying potential vulnerabilities in popular CMSes, but it is important to use it ethically and with permission. Using it on a website without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences. It is always recommended to use CMSmap as part of a comprehensive security testing plan that includes other security tools and techniques.
