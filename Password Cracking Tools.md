Password cracking tools are software applications designed for testing and evaluating the security of passwords. While these tools can be legitimate and useful for security professionals and system administrators, they can also be misused for illegal activities. It's crucial to use password cracking tools responsibly and only on systems for which you have explicit permission to test. Here are some notable password cracking tools:

1. **Hashcat:** As mentioned earlier, Hashcat is a versatile password cracking tool that supports a wide range of hash algorithms and attack types.

2. **John the Ripper (John):** Another popular and open-source password cracking tool, John the Ripper supports various encryption algorithms and attack modes. It's known for its speed and efficiency.

3. **Hydra:** Hydra is a versatile online password-cracking tool that supports various protocols, including SSH, HTTP, FTP, and others. It can perform brute-force and dictionary attacks.

4. **Medusa:** Similar to Hydra, Medusa is a command-line tool that supports various protocols for brute-force attacks, including SSH, FTP, and HTTP.

5. **Cain and Abel:** A Windows-based password recovery tool that can be used for dictionary attacks, brute-force attacks, and cryptanalysis attacks. It supports various protocols, including Windows authentication.

6. **Aircrack-ng:** Primarily used for cracking Wi-Fi passwords, Aircrack-ng is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks. It supports WEP, WPA, and WPA2 security protocols.

7. **RainbowCrack:** RainbowCrack is a hash cracker that utilizes precomputed tables (rainbow tables) to crack passwords. It is effective against hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1.

8. **Ophcrack:** Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker that uses rainbow tables to crack Windows password hashes. It's particularly useful for recovering forgotten passwords.

Remember, the use of password cracking tools should always be within the bounds of ethical and legal guidelines. Unauthorized use of these tools to gain unauthorized access to systems, networks, or accounts is illegal and unethical. Always obtain explicit permission before using password cracking tools on any system. Additionally, organizations should employ strong password policies and use secure password storage mechanisms to enhance overall security.
