ShellShock, also known as the Bash Bug or CVE-2014-6271, is a vulnerability that was discovered in the Bash shell, a widely used command-line interpreter for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.

The vulnerability was disclosed in September 2014 and gained significant attention due to its widespread impact. ShellShock allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system by exploiting a flaw in the way Bash processes environment variables.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that Bash allowed function definitions to be stored in environment variables. An attacker can manipulate an environment variable to include malicious code, which is then executed by Bash when the variable is expanded. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the Bash process.

ShellShock posed a significant risk because Bash is a fundamental component of many Linux and Unix-like systems. It is commonly used in scripts, web servers, and various other applications. Exploiting ShellShock could potentially lead to remote code execution, unauthorized access, data theft, or the compromise of entire systems.

Once the vulnerability was discovered, major Linux distributions and vendors promptly released patches and updates to address the issue. System administrators were advised to apply these patches to mitigate the risk. Additionally, security teams worldwide raised awareness about the vulnerability and provided guidance on securing affected systems.

It's important to note that keeping software and systems up to date with the latest security patches is crucial to protect against vulnerabilities like ShellShock. Regularly updating Bash and other software components helps to mitigate the risk of potential exploits.
