While the term "universal laptop charger" is often used commercially, it's important to understand that a truly universal charger for all laptops doesn't exist due to the variety of power requirements and connector types used by different manufacturers.

However, there are two main categories of chargers that are often marketed as "universal" and can be suitable options for charging various laptops under certain conditions:

1. **AC adapters with interchangeable tips:** These chargers come with a main power supply unit and a set of detachable tips that fit different laptop connector types.

- **Pros:**
    - Can potentially charge a variety of laptops with compatible tip sizes.
    - Relatively affordable option.
- **Cons:**
    - Requires finding the correct tip that fits your specific laptop model.
    - Might not always provide the exact power output required by your laptop, potentially leading to slower charging or reduced performance.
    - Not recommended for high-powered gaming laptops or workstations that require specific charging requirements.

2. **USB-C chargers with Power Delivery (PD):** These chargers use the USB-C port, which is becoming increasingly common in laptops, and support Power Delivery (PD) technology. PD allows the charger to dynamically adjust the voltage and current output to meet the specific needs of the connected device, offering wider compatibility.

- **Pros:**
    - Can potentially charge a wider range of laptops with USB-C ports that support PD.
    - PD technology ensures the charger delivers the appropriate power for faster and safer charging.
    - Often more compact and portable than traditional laptop chargers.
- **Cons:**
    - Requires your laptop to have a USB-C port that supports PD.
    - Generally more expensive than traditional AC adapters.

**Important considerations before using a "universal" laptop charger:**

- **Always consult your laptop's user manual or manufacturer's website to confirm the recommended charging specifications (voltage, amperage, etc.).** Using an incompatible charger can damage your laptop battery or even pose safety risks.
- **Double-check the tip compatibility or ensure your laptop has a USB-C port with PD support before purchasing a "universal" charger.**
- **Opt for reputable brands and certified chargers** to ensure quality, safety, and reliable performance.

Remember, while "universal" laptop chargers offer some level of versatility, it's crucial to prioritize compatibility and safety by using a charger that meets your laptop's specific requirements. If you're unsure about compatibility, it's always best to consult the manufacturer or a qualified professional for guidance.
