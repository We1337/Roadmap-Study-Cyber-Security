As of my last update in September 2021, I am not aware of a specific penetration testing tool or utility called "generic_chunked." It's possible that this tool has emerged or been developed after that time. However, without more information, I cannot provide specific details about its features or usage.

If "generic_chunked" is indeed a penetration testing tool, I recommend the following steps:

2. **GitHub Repositories**: Many open-source security tools are hosted on platforms like GitHub. You might find the tool's repository, which could include documentation and usage instructions.
3. **Community Feedback**: If "generic_chunked" is a tool that security professionals are using, you might find discussions or mentions of it in online communities, forums, and social media platforms related to penetration testing and security research.
4. **Tool Documentation**: If you find the tool's documentation, it should provide details about its features, commands, and how it can be used for penetration testing.
5. **Vendor or Developer Information**: If "generic_chunked" is a commercial tool, visiting the vendor's website or contacting the developer might provide more information.
