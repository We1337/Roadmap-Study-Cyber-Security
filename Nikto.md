Nikto is an **open-source web server scanner and vulnerability assessment tool**. It is designed to identify potential security weaknesses in web servers and web applications by scanning them for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations. It's a popular choice due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and ease of use.

Here's a closer look at Nikto:

**Functionality:**

- **Scans for vulnerabilities:** Nikto checks for various vulnerabilities in web servers and applications, including:
    - **Outdated software:** It identifies outdated versions of web server software, plugins, and other components, which can be vulnerable to known exploits.
    - **Dangerous files and programs:** It searches for potentially harmful files and programs like CGI scripts that could be exploited by attackers.
