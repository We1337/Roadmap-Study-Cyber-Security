"DeAuth" is a shorthand term commonly used to refer to a Deauthentication (Deauth) frame or packet in the context of wireless networks.

Deauthentication is a wireless management frame used to terminate an authenticated session between a client device and an access point (AP). It is a legitimate and standardized mechanism within the IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi) protocol for network management purposes.

Deauth frames are typically sent by the AP to a specific client device, or in some cases, a client device may send a Deauth frame to the AP. The purpose of a Deauth frame is to immediately and forcibly disconnect a client from the wireless network.

Deauthentication frames can be used for various reasons, including network troubleshooting, enforcing security policies, or managing network resources. For example, network administrators may use Deauth frames to disconnect unauthorized or suspicious devices from the network.

However, it's important to note that unauthorized use of Deauth frames with malicious intent, such as disrupting legitimate network connections or performing Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, is illegal and unethical.

It is crucial to use such features responsibly and within the boundaries of the law and ethical guidelines.
