The `ltrace` command is another diagnostic tool used in Unix-like operating systems, particularly Linux, to trace library calls made by a process. While `strace` traces system calls, `ltrace` focuses on library calls, providing insights into dynamic library usage by a program.

Here's a basic usage example:

```bash
ltrace <command>
```

Replace `<command>` with the command you want to trace. For example:

```bash
ltrace ls -l
```

This command will execute the `ls -l` command and print a detailed trace of library calls made by the `ls` program.

Some common options for the `ltrace` command include:

- `-c`: This option counts the number of calls for each library function and reports a summary at the end.

  ```bash
  ltrace -c ls -l
  ```

- `-f`: This option follows child processes as they are created, providing a trace of the entire process tree.

  ```bash
  ltrace -f ./my_program
  ```

- `-o <output-file>`: This option redirects the output to a file instead of printing it to the console.

  ```bash
  ltrace -o output.txt ls -l
  ```

- `-p <pid>`: This option attaches to an existing process specified by its process ID.

  ```bash
  ltrace -p 1234
  ```

Similar to `strace`, `ltrace` is useful for debugging and understanding program behavior. It can help identify which library functions are being called, the arguments passed to them, and the return values. This information is valuable for diagnosing issues, tracking down bugs, and gaining insights into the inner workings of a program.
