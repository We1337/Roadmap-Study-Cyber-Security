When checking HTTP responses for sensitive information, there are a few important considerations:

1. **SSL/TLS encryption**: Ensure that the communication between the client and the server is encrypted using HTTPS. This helps protect the sensitive data in transit and prevents unauthorized interception.
2. **Response headers**: Check the response headers for any sensitive information. Common headers to inspect include:
    -   **Set-Cookie**: Look for cookies that may contain sensitive session information or authentication tokens.
    -   **Authorization**: Check for any sensitive authorization tokens or credentials.
    -   **Location**: Verify that there are no unexpected redirects or sensitive URLs disclosed.
    -   **WWW-Authenticate**: Ensure that the authentication challenge does not reveal sensitive information.
3. **Response body**: Inspect the response body for any unintended information disclosure. Here are some areas to pay attention to:
    -   **Error messages**: Look for detailed error messages that could reveal sensitive system information or application-specific details.
    -   **HTML comments**: Check for comments within HTML source code that might contain sensitive information.
    -   **Hidden form fields**: Ensure that there are no hidden form fields containing sensitive data that could be exposed.
    -   **JSON/XML responses**: Parse and review structured data responses, checking for any unintended sensitive information.
4.  **Status codes**: Pay attention to the status codes returned by the server. Some error codes, such as 500 Internal Server Error or 401 Unauthorized, may provide clues about potential security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Authentication and authorization**: Verify that the authentication and authorization mechanisms are implemented correctly and do not leak sensitive information.
6.  **Secure response handling**: Ensure that the client-side application handling the response (e.g., JavaScript code) is designed to handle sensitive data securely and avoid unintentional exposure.    

Additionally, it's crucial to follow security best practices, such as minimizing the exposure of sensitive data, implementing strong access controls, and regularly updating and patching software to address known vulnerabilities.
