In MongoDB, `$where` is a query operator that allows you to use a JavaScript expression to perform more complex queries. It can be used in conjunction with other query operators to filter documents in a collection based on the result of a JavaScript expression.

Here is an example of how to use `$where`

```
db.collection.find({ $where: "this.name.length > 5" })
```

In this example, we're querying a collection for documents where the `name` field has a length greater than 5. The `$where` operator allows us to use a JavaScript expression to perform this query.

While `$where` can be useful for performing more complex queries, it's important to use it carefully, as it can impact performance. When using `$where`, MongoDB will execute a JavaScript function for each document in the collection, which can be slower than using other query operators.

In general, it's recommended to use other query operators whenever possible, and only use `$where` when you need to perform more complex queries that cannot be expressed using other operators.
