Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed, multi-model database service provided by Microsoft Azure. It is designed to provide high availability, scalability, and performance for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT applications.

Cosmos DB supports multiple data models, including document, key-value, graph, and column-family, and allows you to store and query data using multiple APIs, including SQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Azure Table Storage.

One of the key features of Cosmos DB is its ability to provide low-latency access to data across multiple regions, using its global distribution capability. It also provides automatic scaling and throughput provisioning, as well as built-in data replication and disaster recovery.

Cosmos DB is integrated with other Azure services, such as Azure Functions, Azure Stream Analytics, and Azure Search, and supports a range of client libraries for popular programming languages.

Cosmos DB is a popular choice for applications that require low latency, high throughput, and global availability, as well as those that need to support multiple data models and APIs. However, it may not be suitable for all use cases, particularly those that require complex querying or require strong consistency guarantees.
