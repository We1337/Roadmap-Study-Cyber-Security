Google dorks, also known as Google hacking or Google dorking, refer to specific search queries used to find vulnerable websites or information that is not easily accessible through conventional search methods. These advanced search operators allow users to narrow down their search results and find specific types of information.

Here are a few examples of commonly used Google dorks:

1. Site-specific search: "site:example.com" - This dork restricts the search results to a specific website, replacing "example.com" with the desired domain name.
2. File type search: "filetype:pdf" - This dork helps find specific file types, such as PDFs, Word documents, or Excel spreadsheets.
3. Directory listing: "intitle:index.of" - This dork reveals directory listings of websites, which may expose sensitive information or files.
4. Login pages: "inurl:login" - This dork searches for websites with "login" in the URL, potentially exposing login pages that might be vulnerable.
5. Vulnerable servers: "intitle:index.of /" - This dork finds servers with directory listings, which could lead to information disclosure if not properly secured.
6. Username or password exposure: "intext:username filetype:txt" - This dork searches for files that contain usernames, potentially exposing user credentials.

Please note that while these examples are provided for informational purposes, it is important to use Google dorks ethically and responsibly. Unauthorized access to systems or the exploitation of vulnerabilities is illegal and can result in severe consequences. Always ensure you have proper authorization before attempting to use any techniques or tools to access or manipulate online resources.
