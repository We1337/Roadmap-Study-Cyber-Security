As an AI language model, I do not have access to any specific systems or applications, but I can provide you with a list of some common attack vectors that can be used to compromise computer systems and networks:

1. Phishing: It is the most common attack vector where the attacker creates a fake login page or email to trick the user into providing sensitive information.
2. Malware: Malware is any malicious software that can be installed on a user's computer, and it can take many forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, and spyware. 
3. SQL Injection: SQL injection is a type of attack that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in web applications that use SQL databases.
4. Man-in-the-middle (MitM) Attack: In this type of attack, the attacker intercepts communication between two parties and can monitor, alter, or even inject new messages. 
5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a website or web application, which is then executed by unsuspecting users who visit the affected website. 
6. Denial of Service (DoS): A DoS attack aims to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service, server, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of traffic or requests. 
7. Password Attacks: Password attacks can be executed in several ways, such as brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, or social engineering attacks, to gain unauthorized access to a system or account. 
8. Physical Attacks: Physical attacks involve gaining unauthorized access to a system or device by physically tampering with it, such as stealing a laptop, copying data from a server, or planting a malicious device. 
9. Social Engineering: Social engineering attacks are aimed at manipulating users into divulging confidential information, such as passwords or credit card details, by impersonating legitimate entities or exploiting their trust. 
10. Wi-Fi Eavesdropping: Wi-Fi eavesdropping attacks occur when an attacker intercepts unencrypted wireless network traffic to capture sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords, credit card details, or personal data.
