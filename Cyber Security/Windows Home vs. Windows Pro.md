Windows Home and Windows Pro are two different editions of the Windows operating system offered by Microsoft. Here are the key differences between Windows Home and Windows Pro:

1. Features: Windows Pro includes all the features of Windows Home, plus additional features specifically targeted towards business and professional use. Some of the additional features in Windows Pro include BitLocker (for encrypting drives), Remote Desktop (for accessing your computer remotely), Domain Join (for connecting to a corporate domain), Group Policy Management (for advanced system configuration), and Hyper-V (for running virtual machines).
2. Price: Windows Home is generally less expensive than Windows Pro, making it a more budget-friendly option for home users or individuals who do not require the advanced features offered by Windows Pro.
3. Business-oriented features: Windows Pro is designed for businesses and professionals, and includes features such as Domain Join, Group Policy Management, and BitLocker that are specifically tailored for business environments. These features allow for easier management and control of multiple computers in a corporate network.
4. Remote Desktop: Windows Pro includes the ability to act as a Remote Desktop host, allowing you to connect to your computer remotely from another device. This feature is useful for remote access and troubleshooting, which can be beneficial in business settings.
5. Virtualization: Windows Pro includes Hyper-V, a virtualization feature that allows you to run virtual machines on your computer. This is useful for developers, IT professionals, and power users who need to run multiple operating systems or test software in different environments.
6. Device Encryption: Windows Pro includes BitLocker, a built-in encryption feature that allows you to encrypt your drives for enhanced security. This feature is not available in Windows Home.
7. Update Control: Windows Pro allows you to defer updates and choose when to install them, providing more control over the update process. Windows Home, on the other hand, installs updates automatically without the option to defer them.
8. Licensing: Windows Pro is typically used in business environments and requires volume licensing or individual licenses for each device. Windows Home is typically used in home environments and is licensed for individual devices.

In summary, Windows Home is a more basic edition of Windows suitable for home users, while Windows Pro includes additional features targeted towards business and professional use. The choice between Windows Home and Windows Pro depends on your specific needs and requirements, such as the need for business-oriented features, remote access, virtualization, and encryption.
