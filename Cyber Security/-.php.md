PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) files are server-side scripting files that are used to generate dynamic web content. PHP is a widely-used scripting language that is embedded in HTML files, allowing developers to create web pages with dynamic content that can be generated based on user input, data from databases, or other sources.

PHP files typically have a `.php` file extension and contain PHP code enclosed in PHP tags (`<?php` and `?>`). The PHP code can be interspersed with HTML markup, allowing developers to mix server-side logic with client-side presentation.

Here's an example of a simple PHP file that generates dynamic content:

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>PHP Example</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, <?php echo "World!"; ?></h1>
    <p>Today is <?php echo date('Y-m-d'); ?></p>
    <?php
    $name = "John";
    $age = 30;
    echo "<p>My name is $name and I'm $age years old.</p>";
    ?>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the PHP code is embedded within the HTML markup using PHP tags. The PHP code is enclosed between `<?php` and `?>` tags, and it can contain variables, expressions, control structures (such as if statements and loops), and function calls, among other things.

In this example, the PHP code uses the `echo` statement to output dynamic content to the web page. The `date()` function is used to get the current date, and variables `$name` and `$age` are used to generate personalized content within the HTML markup.

PHP files are processed on the server-side by a PHP interpreter, which executes the PHP code and generates dynamic content. The resulting HTML output is then sent to the web browser, which renders it as a web page for the user. PHP files can also interact with databases, handle form submissions, and perform other server-side tasks, making them a powerful tool for creating dynamic and interactive web applications.
