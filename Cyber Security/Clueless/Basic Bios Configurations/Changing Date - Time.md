Changing the date and time in BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) can be necessary if the system clock is incorrect, which can cause issues with various functions of your computer, such as file timestamps, software licensing, and other time-sensitive processes.

Here are the steps to change the date and time in BIOS:

1. Restart your computer and enter BIOS mode. This can be done by pressing a specific key during startup, such as F2, F10, or Del. The specific key may vary depending on your computer's manufacturer and model, so consult your computer's documentation or look for on-screen prompts during startup.
2. Once you're in BIOS mode, use the arrow keys to navigate to the "Date and Time" or "System Date and Time" option.
3. Select the option and use the arrow keys to adjust the date and time values.
4. Once you have set the correct date and time, save the changes and exit BIOS. This can usually be done by pressing the F10 key or selecting the "Save and Exit" option.
5. Finally, let your computer boot up normally and check that the date and time are now displaying correctly.

Note that changing the date and time in BIOS can have implications for your system and may cause issues with some software or applications. It's important to ensure that you have set the correct date and time, and to check that your system clock is functioning correctly after making any changes.
