Secure Boot is a security feature of modern computers that ensures only trusted operating system software can run on the system during startup. It was introduced by Microsoft as a part of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) specification.

Secure Boot works by verifying the digital signature of the operating system boot loader and any other critical system components, such as drivers or firmware, before they are loaded into memory. If the signature does not match a trusted key stored in the system's firmware, the component is not loaded and the system will not boot.

The purpose of Secure Boot is to prevent the loading of malicious or unauthorized software during startup, such as rootkits or bootkits, which can bypass antivirus and other security measures. It also helps protect against firmware-based attacks, such as those that exploit vulnerabilities in the system's firmware to gain access to sensitive information.

To use Secure Boot, the system's firmware must have a trusted key installed, such as one provided by the manufacturer or a certificate authority. The operating system boot loader and any other critical system components must be signed with a digital certificate that matches the trusted key. This ensures that only trusted software is allowed to run during startup.

Secure Boot can be enabled or disabled in the system's BIOS or UEFI settings, depending on the motherboard and firmware version. It is typically enabled by default on most modern computers, and disabling it is not recommended unless it is necessary to install an operating system or driver that is not signed with a trusted certificate.

It is important to note that while Secure Boot provides an additional layer of security, it is not a guarantee against all forms of attacks. It is still important to use other security measures, such as antivirus software and regular system updates, to protect against potential threats.
