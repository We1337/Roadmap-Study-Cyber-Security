Image files are digital files that contain visual data in the form of graphics, pictures, or photographs. These files store visual information that can be rendered as images on electronic devices such as computer screens, mobile devices, and printers.

There are several common image file formats used for storing digital images, each with its own characteristics and intended use. Some of the most common image file formats include:

1. JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group): JPEG is a widely used image file format for storing compressed photographs and graphics. It is suitable for images with complex colors and detailed content, such as digital photos. JPEG files are commonly used for displaying images on the web and in digital media.
2. PNG (Portable Network Graphics): PNG is a lossless image file format that supports transparency and is suitable for images with sharp lines, text, and graphics. PNG files are commonly used for web graphics, logos, icons, and other images that require high-quality with transparent backgrounds.
3. GIF (Graphics Interchange Format): GIF is a compressed image file format that supports animation and is suitable for simple graphics and animations with limited colors. GIF files are commonly used for small graphics, icons, and animations on the web.
4. BMP (Bitmap): BMP is a standard image file format that stores uncompressed raster graphics data. BMP files are typically larger in size compared to other image formats, but they provide high-quality images with no loss of detail. BMP files are commonly used in applications that require high-quality images with no compression, such as printing and image editing.
5. TIFF (Tagged Image File Format): TIFF is a versatile image file format that supports lossless compression and is suitable for storing high-quality images with complex colors and detailed content. TIFF files are commonly used in professional printing and publishing applications, as well as in archival and preservation contexts.
6. JPEG 2000: JPEG 2000 is an advanced image file format that provides superior compression compared to JPEG, with support for lossless and lossy compression. JPEG 2000 files are commonly used in applications that require high-quality images with efficient compression, such as medical imaging, satellite imagery, and digital cinema.

These are just some of the common image file formats used for storing digital images. Each image file format has its own advantages, disadvantages, and use cases, and the appropriate format to use depends on the specific requirements of the application or context in which the images will be used.
