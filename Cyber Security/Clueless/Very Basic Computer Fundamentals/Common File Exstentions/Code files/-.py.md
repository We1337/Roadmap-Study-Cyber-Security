".py" is a file extension used in Python programming language to denote Python source code files. Python is a high-level, interpreted, and dynamically-typed programming language that is widely used for various applications such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Python source code files typically contain Python code written using the syntax and features of the Python programming language, and they can be executed directly by a Python interpreter or compiled into bytecode for execution. Python code files usually have the ".py" file extension, although they may also have other extensions such as ".pyw" (for Python Windows scripts) or ".pyc" (for compiled Python files).
