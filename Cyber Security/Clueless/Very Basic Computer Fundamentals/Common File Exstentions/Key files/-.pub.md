".pub" is a file extension used in the context of SSH (Secure Shell) key pairs. In SSH, a key pair consists of a private key and a public key. The private key is kept secret and is used for authentication, while the public key is shared with remote systems to verify the authenticity of the user attempting to access the system.

The ".pub" file extension is used to denote the public key file. It contains the public key portion of the SSH key pair and is usually generated from the corresponding private key. The public key is typically used by remote systems to verify that the user attempting to access the system possesses the private key associated with the public key. The public key file can be distributed to remote systems or added to authorized key lists to grant access without requiring a password for authentication.

It's important to note that the private key should be kept secure and not shared, while the public key can be safely shared with others. The ".pub" file extension is used to specifically identify the public key file in the context of SSH key pairs, and it plays a crucial role in enabling secure authentication and access to remote systems using SSH.
