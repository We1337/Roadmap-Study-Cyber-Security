Enabling and disabling devices in the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is a different process than in the operating system. Here are the steps to enable or disable devices in the BIOS:

1. Turn on or restart your computer and enter the BIOS by pressing the key or combination of keys indicated during the boot process. The key or combination of keys to enter the BIOS may vary depending on the manufacturer and model of your computer. Common keys to enter the BIOS include F2, F10, and Delete.
2. Once you are in the BIOS, navigate to the section that contains the device you want to enable or disable. This section may be labeled "Integrated Peripherals," "Onboard Devices," or something similar.
3. Select the device you want to enable or disable and use the arrow keys to change its status. The options may be "Enabled" or "Disabled."
4. Save your changes and exit the BIOS. The key or combination of keys to save and exit the BIOS may vary depending on the manufacturer and model of your computer. Common keys to save and exit the BIOS include F10 and Escape.

Note: Be careful when making changes in the BIOS, as incorrect settings can cause your computer to malfunction. Always read the instructions carefully and consult the manufacturer's documentation or support website if you are unsure.
