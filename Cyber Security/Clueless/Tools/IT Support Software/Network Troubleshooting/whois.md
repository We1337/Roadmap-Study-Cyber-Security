Whois is a command-line utility that allows you to query a public database of domain name registration information. With whois, you can look up the owner, administrative and technical contacts, and other registration details for a domain name.

Here are some common whois commands:

1. whois [domain name]: This command looks up the registration information for the specified domain name.
2. whois -h [whois server] [domain name]: This command looks up the registration information for the specified domain name using the specified whois server.

By using whois, you can obtain information about the owner and registration status of a domain name, such as the name of the registrant, the registrar that the domain is registered with, and the date that the domain was registered or last updated. This information can be helpful for verifying the authenticity of a website or domain name, investigating potential trademark or copyright infringement, and identifying the owner of a domain name for business or legal purposes.
