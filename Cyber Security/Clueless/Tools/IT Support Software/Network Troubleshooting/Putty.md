PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. It supports several network protocols, including SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and SCP, as well as raw socket connections. PuTTY was originally developed for Windows, but it has been ported to other operating systems including Unix, macOS, and Linux.

PuTTY is particularly useful for remote system administration, providing a secure way to access a remote system over a network using SSH. It can also be used to connect to serial console ports on devices such as routers and switches, and to transfer files between systems using SCP.

Some of the key features of PuTTY include:

-   Support for SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connections.
-   Multiple sessions can be managed using a tabbed interface.
-   Configurable keyboard shortcuts and color schemes.
-   Support for SSH key authentication.
-   Support for local and remote port forwarding.
-   Integration with third-party tools such as WinSCP for file transfer.

To use PuTTY, you need to download and install it on your local system. Once installed, you can open the PuTTY application and enter the hostname or IP address of the remote system you want to connect to, along with the appropriate protocol and port number. You can then enter your login credentials and begin working with the remote system.
