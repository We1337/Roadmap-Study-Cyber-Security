Netstat (network statistics) is a command-line tool that displays network connections, routing tables, and a variety of network interface and protocol statistics. It is available on most Unix-like operating systems and Windows.

The netstat command can be used to:

-   Display active network connections (both incoming and outgoing)
-   Show network interface statistics such as packets received and sent, errors, and collisions
-   Display routing table information
-   Show multicast group memberships
-   Display network protocol statistics such as TCP, UDP, and ICMP

Here are some commonly used options for the netstat command:

-   `-a`: Displays all active connections and listening ports.
-   `-n`: Displays numerical addresses and port numbers instead of attempting to resolve host and service names.
-   `-p`: Displays the process ID (PID) and name of the program that initiated the connection.
-   `-r`: Displays the kernel routing table.
-   `-s`: Displays statistics for each protocol.

For example, the following command will display all active connections and listening ports on a Linux system:

```
netstat -a
```
