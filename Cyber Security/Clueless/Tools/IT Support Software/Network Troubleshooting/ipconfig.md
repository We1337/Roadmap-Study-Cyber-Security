ipconfig is a command-line utility in Windows that provides information about your computer's network configuration. It displays the IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway of your network adapters, as well as other network-related information.

Here are some common ipconfig commands:

1. ipconfig /all: This command displays detailed information about all network adapters on your computer, including their IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, DNS server, and other configuration settings.
2. ipconfig /release: This command releases the IP address assigned to your computer by the DHCP server.
3. ipconfig /renew: This command requests a new IP address from the DHCP server.
4. ipconfig /flushdns: This command clears the DNS resolver cache, which may resolve DNS-related issues.
5. ipconfig /displaydns: This command displays the contents of the DNS resolver cache.

By using ipconfig, you can troubleshoot network connectivity issues, check your network settings, and obtain information about your network configuration.
