The `arp -a` command is used to display the ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) cache table on a system. The ARP cache table is a list of IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses that the system has recently communicated with.

When a system wants to communicate with another system on a network, it needs to know the MAC address of the destination system. The ARP protocol is used to map an IP address to a MAC address. The ARP cache table stores the results of recent ARP requests, so that subsequent communication with the same system can be faster.

The `arp -a` command displays the contents of the ARP cache table on the system. It shows the IP addresses and MAC addresses of systems that the local system has recently communicated with. If the ARP cache table is empty, the command will not display any output.

Here's an example output of the `arp -a` command:

```
Interface: 192.168.1.100 --- 0xa
  Internet Address      Physical Address      Type
  192.168.1.1           00-11-22-33-44-55     dynamic
  192.168.1.10          00-aa-bb-cc-dd-ee     dynamic
```

This output shows the IP addresses and MAC addresses of two systems that the local system has recently communicated with. The `dynamic` type indicates that the MAC address was learned through an ARP request, as opposed to being manually configured.
