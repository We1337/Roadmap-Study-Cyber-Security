Nslookup (short for "Name Server Lookup") is a command-line utility in Windows that allows you to query the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain information about domain names and IP addresses. With nslookup, you can look up the IP address associated with a domain name or the domain name associated with an IP address.

Here are some common nslookup commands:

1. nslookup [domain name]: This command looks up the IP address associated with the specified domain name.
2. nslookup [IP address]: This command looks up the domain name associated with the specified IP address.
3. nslookup -type=mx [domain name]: This command looks up the mail exchange (MX) records for the specified domain name.
4. nslookup -type=ns [domain name]: This command looks up the name server (NS) records for the specified domain name.

By using nslookup, you can obtain information about domain names and IP addresses, such as the IP address of a website's server, the mail exchange server for a domain, or the name servers responsible for a domain's DNS records. This information can be helpful for diagnosing DNS-related issues, troubleshooting network connectivity problems, and verifying domain name resolution.
