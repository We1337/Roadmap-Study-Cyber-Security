Tracert (short for "Trace Route") is a command-line utility in Windows that allows you to trace the path of data packets as they travel from your computer to a specified destination on a network. Tracert can be used to diagnose network connectivity issues and identify where in the network a problem is occurring.

When you run the tracert command with a specified destination, it sends out a series of packets with increasing time-to-live (TTL) values, starting from 1. Each router or network device along the path of the packets decrements the TTL value by one, and if the TTL reaches zero, the router discards the packet and sends back an ICMP "Time Exceeded" message to the source computer. By analyzing the "Time Exceeded" messages received from each router, tracert can display a list of the routers or network devices along the path from your computer to the destination.

Here is an example of a tracert command:

```
tracert google.com
```

This command traces the path of packets from your computer to the Google website. The output shows the list of routers and network devices along the path, along with the round-trip time (in milliseconds) for each hop.

By using tracert, you can identify where in the network a problem is occurring, such as a router or network device that is causing latency or packet loss. This information can be helpful for diagnosing network connectivity issues and troubleshooting network problems.
