"SFC" stands for System File Checker, and it is a command-line utility built into Windows that allows you to scan and repair corrupted or missing system files. Running "sfc /scannow" will initiate a scan of all protected system files and replace any missing or corrupted files with a cached copy that is located in a compressed folder at %WinDir%\System32\dllcache.

To run the "sfc /scannow" command, you can open a command prompt with administrator privileges and enter the command. The scan can take some time to complete, depending on the size of your system and the number of files that need to be scanned.

It is recommended to run the "sfc /scannow" command if you are experiencing problems with your Windows system, such as system crashes, blue screens of death, or issues with Windows updates. If the scan finds any corrupted or missing system files, it will attempt to repair them automatically.

If the "sfc /scannow" command is not able to fix the issue, you may need to perform additional troubleshooting or seek help from a professional.
