Safe Mode is a diagnostic startup mode in Windows that starts your computer with a minimal set of drivers, services, and applications. Safe Mode is designed to help troubleshoot issues with your computer by allowing you to start it with only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows.

When you start your computer in Safe Mode, it will only load essential system files and drivers, so you can isolate problems with third-party software, device drivers, or malware that might be causing issues with your computer.

To enter Safe Mode, you need to restart your computer and press the F8 key repeatedly before the Windows logo appears. This will bring up the Advanced Boot Options menu, where you can select "Safe Mode" or "Safe Mode with Networking" depending on whether you need to access the internet or not.

Alternatively, in Windows 10, you can enter Safe Mode by going to the "Start" menu, clicking on "Power," and then holding down the "Shift" key while clicking on "Restart." This will bring up the "Choose an option" menu, where you can select "Troubleshoot," "Advanced options," and then "Startup Settings" to restart your computer in Safe Mode.

In Safe Mode, your computer may appear differently than it does in normal mode, with lower resolution graphics and a limited desktop environment. However, it can be a useful tool for troubleshooting and resolving issues with your computer.
