DISM stands for Deployment Image Servicing and Management, and it is a command-line tool built into Windows that allows you to manage and repair Windows system images, including the Windows Recovery Environment, Windows Preinstallation Environment, and Windows PE.

You can use DISM to service a Windows image, prepare a Windows PE image, or repair a corrupted Windows image. Some of the tasks you can perform with DISM include adding or removing drivers, features, packages, and updates, as well as checking the health of an image, mounting an image, and capturing or applying an image.

To use DISM, you need to open a command prompt with administrator privileges and enter the appropriate command and parameters for the task you want to perform. Some examples of DISM commands include:

- "dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth": This command scans the Windows image for corruption and repairs any issues it finds.  
- "dism /online /enable-feature /featurename:NetFx3 /all /source:d:\sources\sxs": This command enables the .NET Framework 3.5 feature on the local computer and specifies the source files to use for installation.  
- "dism /online /get-packages": This command lists all the packages installed on the local computer.  

DISM is a powerful tool that can be used to manage and repair Windows system images, but it is also a complex tool that should be used with caution. It is recommended to have a good understanding of the tool and its commands before attempting to use it, and to always create a backup or restore point before making any changes to your system image.
