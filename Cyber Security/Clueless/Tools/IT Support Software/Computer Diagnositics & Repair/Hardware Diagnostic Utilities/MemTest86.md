MemTest86 is a popular memory diagnostic utility used to test the functionality of the RAM installed on your computer. This utility runs outside of the Windows operating system, allowing it to test the RAM independently of any software or drivers that may be causing issues.

MemTest86 works by writing a series of patterns to each memory address, then reading back the data to ensure that it matches the expected pattern. This process is repeated multiple times to thoroughly test the RAM. If errors are detected, MemTest86 will report them and provide information on the location of the error.

MemTest86 can be run from a bootable USB drive or CD/DVD. To use MemTest86, you will need to download the software from the official website and create a bootable media using the provided instructions. Once the media is created, you can boot your computer from it and run MemTest86 to test your RAM.

It is recommended to run MemTest86 for at least a few hours to ensure that the RAM is fully tested. If errors are detected, it may be necessary to replace the faulty RAM module or modules to prevent system crashes, data corruption, or other issues.

Overall, MemTest86 is a powerful and reliable tool for testing the functionality of your computer's RAM and can help diagnose and troubleshoot memory-related issues.
