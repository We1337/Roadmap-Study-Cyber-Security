System logs are a record of system events and can be an essential resource for troubleshooting and diagnosing problems with your Windows computer. Here are some steps to review system logs:

1. Open the Event Viewer: Click on the Start button and type "Event Viewer" in the search bar. Then, click on the Event Viewer app in the search results.
2. Navigate to the System Log: In the Event Viewer window, expand the "Windows Logs" folder in the left-hand pane and click on the "System" log.
3. Filter the log: By default, the log will show all system events, including informational messages, warnings, and errors. To filter the log to show only error events, click on the "Filter Current Log" option in the right-hand pane. In the filter window, select the "Error" option and click "OK."
4. Review the log: The log will now show only error events. Review the events to see if there are any recurring issues or patterns. Each event will include a description of the problem, the date and time it occurred, and any relevant details.
5. Take action: Depending on the type of error and the severity, you may need to take action to resolve the issue. Some errors may be benign and can be safely ignored, while others may require updates, software installations, or hardware replacements.
6. Clear the log: Once you've reviewed the log and taken any necessary actions, it's a good idea to clear the log to keep it clean and organized. To clear the log, right-click on the "System" log in the left-hand pane and select "Clear Log."

In summary, reviewing system logs can help you identify and troubleshoot problems with your Windows computer. By following these steps, you can filter and review the system log to identify recurring issues and take action to resolve them.
