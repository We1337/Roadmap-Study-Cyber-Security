GPU memory, also known as graphics memory or video memory, refers to the dedicated high-speed memory that is built into a graphics processing unit (GPU) or graphics card. GPU memory is used to store graphical data, such as textures, frame buffers, and other graphics-related data that is required for rendering images or videos on a display.

The amount of GPU memory in a graphics card is typically specified in gigabytes (GB) and is an important factor in determining the performance and capabilities of a GPU. GPUs with larger amounts of memory can handle larger and more complex datasets, textures, and scenes, which can result in better performance in tasks such as gaming, 3D rendering, video editing, and other graphics-intensive applications.

It's important to note that GPU memory is separate from system memory (RAM), which is used by the CPU for general computing tasks. GPU memory is optimized for the specific requirements of graphics processing, such as high-speed data transfers and parallel processing, and is designed to work in tandem with the GPU's processing power to deliver smooth graphics performance. GPU memory can come in various types, such as GDDR6, GDDR5, or HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), each with different characteristics in terms of speed, bandwidth, and power consumption.
