An RJ45 wire tracer, also known as a tone and probe kit, is a tool used to trace the path of Ethernet cables and identify specific cables within a bundle or in a wall. It consists of two parts: a tone generator and a probe.

The tone generator is a small device that is connected to one end of an Ethernet cable. It sends out an audible signal, usually a high-pitched tone, which travels along the wires in the cable. The probe is a handheld device with a speaker and an indicator light. It is used to detect the tone generated by the tone generator and identify the specific cable that it is attached to.

To use an RJ45 wire tracer, the tone generator is connected to one end of an Ethernet cable and the probe is used to scan the cables in the bundle or in the wall. When the probe detects the tone from the tone generator, it produces an audible signal and lights up, indicating that it has found the correct cable.

RJ45 wire tracers are essential tools for anyone who works with Ethernet cabling, as they can save a significant amount of time and effort when tracing cables in complex installations. They can also be used to identify cable faults or locate cables that have been damaged or disconnected.

When choosing an RJ45 wire tracer, it is important to look for a high-quality and reliable model that can accurately detect the tone signal and identify the correct cable. Some models may also come with additional features such as a built-in continuity tester or a cable mapping function for more advanced troubleshooting.
