Ethernet cable crimpers are tools used to attach connectors to the ends of Ethernet cables. These connectors, known as RJ45 connectors, are what allow Ethernet cables to plug into network devices such as routers, switches, and network interface cards (NICs) in computers.

Ethernet cable crimpers are typically hand-held tools that consist of a pair of handles and a crimping mechanism. They may also come with interchangeable dies or jaws to accommodate different types of connectors.

When using an Ethernet cable crimper, the first step is to strip away a portion of the cable jacket using a wire stripper or scissors. This exposes the individual wires within the cable, which must be carefully arranged in the correct order according to the wiring standard being used (such as T568A or T568B). The wires are then inserted into the RJ45 connector and the connector is placed in the crimper. Squeezing the handles of the crimper crimps the connector onto the wires, creating a secure and reliable connection.

Ethernet cable crimpers are essential tools for anyone who needs to make their own Ethernet cables, whether for home networking, office cabling, or professional installations. They come in a range of sizes and styles, from basic manual crimpers to more advanced models with interchangeable dies and ratcheting mechanisms for consistent crimping pressure.
