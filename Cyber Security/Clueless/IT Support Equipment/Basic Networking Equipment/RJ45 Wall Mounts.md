An RJ45 wall mount is a component used to secure an Ethernet cable to a wall or other flat surface. It is typically used in conjunction with an RJ45 wall jack or keystone jack to provide a secure and stable connection for Ethernet devices.

RJ45 wall mounts come in various shapes and sizes, but most are designed to hold an RJ45 keystone jack or a surface mount box. They are typically made of plastic or metal and may have adhesive backing or screws for attachment to a wall or other surface.

When installing an RJ45 wall mount, it is important to ensure that it is securely attached to the surface and that the cable is properly routed through the mount. This helps to prevent damage to the cable and ensures a stable and reliable connection for Ethernet devices.

RJ45 wall mounts are commonly used in commercial and residential settings, such as office buildings, schools, and homes, where Ethernet cabling is used for networking and internet connectivity. They are an essential component of any structured cabling installation, providing a neat and organized way to manage Ethernet cables and ensure optimal performance.
