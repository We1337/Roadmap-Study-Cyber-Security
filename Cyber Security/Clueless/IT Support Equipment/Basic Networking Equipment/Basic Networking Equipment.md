3. Modem: A modem is a device that connects your network to the internet via a broadband connection such as cable or DSL. It converts the digital signals from your network into analog signals that can be transmitted over a phone line or cable.
4. Access point: An access point is a device that extends the range of your wireless network. It allows devices to connect to your network wirelessly.
5. Network cables: Network cables are used to connect devices to the network. There are several types of network cables, including Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and coaxial cables.
