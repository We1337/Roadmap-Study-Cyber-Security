C13 power cords are a type of power cord commonly used in computer systems, servers, and other electronic equipment. They are designed to connect the power supply unit (PSU) to a wall outlet or power distribution unit (PDU).

C13 power cords feature a C13 connector on one end and a standard AC plug on the other end. The C13 connector is a female connector that is commonly found on the PSU of computer systems and servers. It is a 3-prong connector that is designed to fit into a C14 male connector, which is commonly found on PDUs and UPSs (uninterruptible power supplies).

C13 power cords come in various lengths and gauges, allowing users to choose the appropriate cord for their specific needs. The gauge of a power cord determines the amount of current it can handle. It is important to choose a power cord with an appropriate gauge for the amount of power that will be drawn through it.

C13 power cords are typically rated for 10 amps or 15 amps, depending on the gauge of the wire. They are also commonly rated for 250 volts, which is the standard voltage for most electronic equipment.

Overall, C13 power cords are a simple and reliable solution for connecting computer systems, servers, and other electronic equipment to a wall outlet or PDU. They are widely available and come in various lengths and gauges to meet the specific needs of users.
