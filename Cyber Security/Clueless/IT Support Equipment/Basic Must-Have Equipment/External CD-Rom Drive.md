An external CD-ROM drive is an external peripheral device that can be connected to a computer or other device to read and write CD-ROMs (Compact Disc Read-Only Memory). It is an alternative to an internal CD-ROM drive, which is built into a computer's casing.

External CD-ROM drives typically use USB (Universal Serial Bus) or FireWire connections to communicate with the computer. They come in various sizes, shapes, and designs, and are generally portable and easy to use.

External CD-ROM drives are commonly used for reading and writing CDs, such as music CDs, software installation discs, and backup discs. They may also be used to read and write other types of optical media, such as DVDs and Blu-ray discs, depending on the model.

External CD-ROM drives are often used with laptops, which do not have built-in CD-ROM drives. They can also be used with desktop computers to provide additional CD-ROM functionality.

When choosing an external CD-ROM drive, it is important to consider the speed, compatibility, and price. Higher-speed drives can read and write CDs more quickly, while more compatible drives can read and write a wider range of CD formats. Prices can vary widely depending on the features and capabilities of the drive.

Overall, an external CD-ROM drive can be a useful peripheral device for those who need to read or write CDs on a regular basis. They are widely available, easy to use, and can provide additional functionality to computers that do not have built-in CD-ROM drives.
