A USB WiFi dongle is a small device that plugs into a USB port on your computer or other device and provides wireless connectivity. It allows you to connect to a WiFi network without the need for a built-in WiFi adapter or Ethernet cable.

USB WiFi dongles come in different shapes and sizes, but they all perform the same basic function. They contain a wireless chipset that allows your device to connect to WiFi networks and transmit and receive data wirelessly.

Some important factors to consider when choosing a USB WiFi dongle include:

1. Wireless standard: Check which wireless standards the dongle supports, such as 802.11ac or 802.11n. The latest standard, 802.11ax (also known as Wi-Fi 6), offers faster speeds and improved reliability, but it is not yet widely available.
2. Speed: Look for a dongle that supports high data transfer speeds, especially if you plan to use it for activities such as online gaming or streaming video.
3. Range: Consider the range of the dongle, or how far it can transmit and receive wireless signals. If you plan to use the dongle in a large space or far away from the router, look for one with a longer range.
4. Antennas: Some USB WiFi dongles come with external antennas, which can improve the range and signal strength of the dongle. Consider whether you need an external antenna based on your usage.
5. Compatibility: Make sure the dongle is compatible with your device's operating system, such as Windows or macOS.

Overall, a USB WiFi dongle can be a convenient and portable solution for adding wireless connectivity to your computer or other device. When choosing a dongle, consider factors such as wireless standard, speed, range, antennas, and compatibility.
