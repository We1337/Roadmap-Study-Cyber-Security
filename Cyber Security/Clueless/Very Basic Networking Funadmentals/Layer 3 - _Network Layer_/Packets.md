In computer networking, a packet is a unit of data that is transmitted between devices over a network. A packet contains both control information and payload data, which is the actual data being transmitted. Packets are used to transfer data between devices over the network and ensure that the data arrives at its intended destination.

A packet typically consists of a header and a payload. The header contains control information, such as the source and destination addresses, the protocol being used, and the sequence number of the packet. The payload contains the actual data being transmitted, such as a file or email message.

When data is transmitted over a network, it is broken up into smaller packets to make it easier to transmit and to ensure that the data arrives at its destination intact. Each packet is transmitted individually and is reassembled at the destination device to form the original data. This process of breaking up data into packets and reassembling it at the destination is called packet switching.

Packet switching is a fundamental concept in computer networking and is used by many different protocols, including TCP/IP, which is the protocol suite used by the Internet. Packets allow for efficient and reliable transmission of data over the network and enable complex communication between devices.
