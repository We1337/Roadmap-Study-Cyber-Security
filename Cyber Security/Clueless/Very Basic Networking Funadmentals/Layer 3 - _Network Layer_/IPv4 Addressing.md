IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) addressing is a system used to identify devices on a network by assigning them a unique 32-bit IP address. An IPv4 address is written as four numbers (each between 0 and 255) separated by dots, for example, 192.168.1.1.

IPv4 addresses are divided into two parts: the network portion and the host portion. The network portion is used to identify the network to which the device belongs, while the host portion identifies the specific device on the network.

IPv4 addresses are divided into different classes based on the number of bits used for the network and host portions. The most commonly used classes are Class A, Class B, and Class C.

Class A addresses use the first 8 bits to identify the network portion, and the remaining 24 bits to identify the host portion. This allows for up to 126 networks (excluding network 0 and network 127) and up to 16,777,214 hosts per network.

Class B addresses use the first 16 bits to identify the network portion, and the remaining 16 bits to identify the host portion. This allows for up to 16,384 networks and up to 65,534 hosts per network.

Class C addresses use the first 24 bits to identify the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits to identify the host portion. This allows for up to 2,097,152 networks and up to 254 hosts per network.

IPv4 addresses are assigned by Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), which assigns blocks of addresses to regional Internet registries (RIRs), which in turn assign them to organizations and Internet service providers (ISPs).

IPv4 addressing has some limitations, the most significant of which is the limited number of available addresses. With the explosive growth of the internet and the increasing number of connected devices, the pool of available IPv4 addresses is rapidly depleting. This has led to the development of IPv6, which provides a much larger pool of addresses (128-bit addresses) to accommodate the growth of the internet and the increasing number of connected devices.
