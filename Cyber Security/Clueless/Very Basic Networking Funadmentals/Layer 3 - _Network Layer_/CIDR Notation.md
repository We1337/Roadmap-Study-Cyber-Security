CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation is a way of representing an IP address and its associated network mask as a single value. CIDR notation is used to simplify IP address notation and make it easier to understand and manage IP addresses in large networks.

CIDR notation is written as an IP address, followed by a forward slash (/), and then the number of bits in the network mask. For example, the IP address 192.168.1.0 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 can be written in CIDR notation as 192.168.1.0/24. The number 24 represents the number of bits in the subnet mask (in this case, 24 bits), which indicates that the first 24 bits of the IP address are used for the network portion, and the remaining 8 bits are used for the host portion.

CIDR notation allows network administrators to define network boundaries and allocate IP addresses more efficiently. For example, instead of using a Class A, B, or C network address with a fixed subnet mask, CIDR allows administrators to create custom network masks that match their network requirements more precisely. This can reduce the number of unused IP addresses and improve the overall efficiency of the network.

CIDR notation also allows for the aggregation of IP addresses and networks, which can reduce the size of routing tables and improve the performance of the Internet routing system. By combining multiple smaller networks into a single larger network, CIDR allows network administrators to reduce the number of routing entries required, which reduces the overhead of the routing system and improves its scalability.
