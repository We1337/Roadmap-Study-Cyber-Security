Power over Ethernet (PoE) is a technology that allows electrical power to be transmitted over Ethernet cables along with data, enabling network devices to receive power and data connectivity through a single Ethernet cable. PoE eliminates the need for separate power cables and power outlets for network devices, making it easier to deploy and manage network devices in locations where power outlets may be limited or difficult to access.

PoE works by injecting power into the Ethernet cable along with data signals, typically using two of the four pairs of wires in the Ethernet cable. The power is delivered to the network device, such as IP phones, wireless access points, security cameras, and other compatible devices, through the Ethernet cable, which is connected to a PoE-enabled switch or a PoE injector. The powered device (PD) receives the power and uses it to operate, eliminating the need for a separate power source.

PoE is standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) under the IEEE 802.3af, IEEE 802.3at, and IEEE 802.3bt standards. These standards specify the power levels that can be delivered over Ethernet cables and the maximum distances for power transmission, as well as the methods for negotiating power levels between the power sourcing equipment (PSE) and powered devices (PDs).

Some benefits of PoE include simplified cabling and installation, increased flexibility in device placement, reduced installation costs, and centralized power management. PoE is widely used in various applications, including enterprise networks, home networks, industrial settings, smart buildings, and Internet of Things (IoT) deployments, where network devices require both power and data connectivity.
