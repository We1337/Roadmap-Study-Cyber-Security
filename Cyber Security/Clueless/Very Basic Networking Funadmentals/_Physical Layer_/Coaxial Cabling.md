Coaxial cabling, commonly referred to as coaxial cable, is a type of cable that is used for various applications, including data communication, television (TV) broadcasting, and surveillance systems. It is characterized by its cylindrical shape and the presence of a central conductor surrounded by insulating layers and a metallic shield.

Coaxial cable consists of several layers, typically including:

1. Center Conductor: This is the innermost part of the coaxial cable and serves as the core conductor for transmitting the electrical signals. It is usually made of copper or copper-coated steel and carries the data or video signals.
2. Insulating Layer: This layer surrounds the center conductor and provides electrical insulation to prevent interference between the center conductor and the outer metallic shield. It is typically made of materials such as foam or plastic.
3. Metallic Shield: This layer surrounds the insulating layer and provides electromagnetic shielding to protect the inner conductor from external interference and prevent signal loss. It is usually made of a metal foil or a braided wire mesh.
4. Outer Insulating Layer: This is the outermost layer of the coaxial cable and provides additional insulation and protection. It is typically made of materials such as PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or PE (polyethylene).

Coaxial cable is used in various applications due to its excellent shielding properties, which make it resistant to electromagnetic interference and signal loss. It is commonly used for cable TV, satellite TV, broadband internet, and CCTV (closed-circuit television) systems.

Coaxial cable is known for its relatively high bandwidth, which allows for high-speed data transmission over longer distances. It also has low signal attenuation, which means that it can transmit signals over longer distances without significant loss of signal strength. Coaxial cable is also durable and can be used in both indoor and outdoor environments.

In summary, coaxial cabling is a type of cable that consists of a central conductor, insulating layers, and a metallic shield. It is commonly used for data communication, TV broadcasting, and surveillance systems due to its excellent shielding properties, high bandwidth, and low signal attenuation.
