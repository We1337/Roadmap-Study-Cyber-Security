Multi-mode refers to a type of fiber optic cable that is designed to transmit light signals using multiple modes of propagation, which means that the light travels through the fiber along multiple paths, bouncing off the inner walls of the core. Multi-mode fiber optic cables are commonly used for shorter distances and lower bandwidth applications compared to single mode fiber.

The core of a multi-mode fiber optic cable is larger compared to single mode fiber, typically ranging from 50 to 62.5 microns in diameter, which allows for multiple modes of light to propagate through the fiber. Due to the larger core size, multi-mode fiber optic cables are more susceptible to modal dispersion, which is the spreading out of light signals as they travel through the fiber, causing signal distortion and limiting the transmission distance and bandwidth.

Multi-mode fiber optic cables are typically used for shorter distance applications, such as local area networks (LANs), data centers, and campus networks, where the transmission distances are usually within a few kilometers. They are also commonly used for shorter distance communication within buildings or facilities, as well as for applications that do not require high bandwidth or long transmission distances.

Multi-mode fiber optic cables are designed to work with a variety of wavelengths, including 850 nm and 1300 nm, which are commonly used in multi-mode fiber-based communication systems. These wavelengths allow for lower-cost light sources, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), to be used for transmission, making multi-mode fiber more cost-effective for certain applications compared to single mode fiber.

Some key applications of multi-mode fiber optic cables include:

1. Local area networks (LANs): Multi-mode fiber is commonly used for LANs, which are networks that connect devices within a limited geographic area, such as an office building or a campus. Multi-mode fiber provides reliable and cost-effective connectivity for shorter distance communication within LAN environments.
2. Data centers: Multi-mode fiber is often used for data center connectivity, including server-to-switch connections, switch-to-switch connections, and other intra-data center links. Multi-mode fiber allows for high-speed data transmission within the data center environment, where shorter distances are typically required.
3. Campus networks: Multi-mode fiber is used for connectivity between different buildings or facilities within a campus network, where the transmission distances are usually within a few kilometers.
4. Audio/Video applications: Multi-mode fiber is sometimes used for audio/video applications, such as transmitting high-quality audio and video signals over short distances in professional audio/video production environments, multimedia installations, and other similar applications.   

In summary, multi-mode fiber is a type of fiber optic cable that is designed for shorter distance and lower bandwidth applications, typically within a few kilometers. It is commonly used for LANs, data centers, campus networks, and audio/video applications where shorter transmission distances are required, and it is often more cost-effective compared to single mode fiber for certain applications.
