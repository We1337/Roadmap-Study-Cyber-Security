The data-link layer is the second layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and the TCP/IP model. It is responsible for providing reliable communication over the physical layer, which is the first layer of the OSI model. The data-link layer is responsible for transmitting data packets between two devices on the same network.

The data-link layer is divided into two sub-layers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sub-layer and the Media Access Control (MAC) sub-layer.

The LLC sub-layer provides a way for the upper layers to access the media and establishes a logical connection between the two devices. It is responsible for flow control, error checking, and synchronization of data frames.

The MAC sub-layer is responsible for the addressing of data frames, error detection, and medium access control. It also ensures that each device on the network has a unique hardware address called a MAC address.

Some common protocols used at the data-link layer include Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. These protocols use different methods to transmit data, but they all have similar functionalities and are designed to work at the data-link layer.
