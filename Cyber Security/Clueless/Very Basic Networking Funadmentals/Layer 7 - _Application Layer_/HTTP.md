HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring data over the internet. It is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web and is responsible for delivering web pages and other resources to web browsers.

HTTP works by establishing a connection between a client (usually a web browser) and a server (which hosts a website). The client sends a request to the server, asking for a specific resource (such as a web page or an image), and the server responds with the requested data.

HTTP requests and responses are made up of a series of headers and a body. Headers contain information about the request or response, such as the type of data being transferred, the size of the data, and other metadata. The body contains the actual data being transferred, such as the HTML code for a web page or the contents of an image file.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request and response is independent of all others. This can make it difficult to maintain session information (such as user login data) across multiple requests, which is why web developers often use cookies or other mechanisms to store session data.

HTTP has evolved over the years, with new versions (such as HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2) adding new features and performance improvements. HTTPS (HTTP Secure) is a variant of HTTP that uses encryption to secure the data being transferred between the client and server.
