DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical naming system that is used to translate human-readable domain names (such as [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.1) that are used to identify and locate computers on the internet.

When a user enters a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to look up the IP address associated with the domain name. The DNS server responds with the IP address, and the browser uses that address to establish a connection to the website.

DNS operates as a distributed database, with different DNS servers responsible for different parts of the domain name hierarchy. At the top of the hierarchy are the root servers, which are responsible for managing the top-level domains (such as .com, .org, and .net). Below the root servers are the authoritative DNS servers for each domain, which are responsible for managing the domain's DNS records.

DNS records are used to store information about a domain name, such as the IP address of the server that hosts the domain's website, the IP addresses of the domain's mail servers, and other information. Some common types of DNS records include:

1. A (Address) record: Stores the IP address of a domain name.
2. MX (Mail Exchange) record: Stores the IP addresses of the servers that handle email for a domain.
3. CNAME (Canonical Name) record: Creates an alias for a domain name.
4. NS (Name Server) record: Stores the IP addresses of the servers that are authoritative for a domain.

DNS is critical to the functioning of the internet, as it allows users to access websites and other online services using human-readable domain names instead of numeric IP addresses. It is also an important component of network security, as it is often used to block access to malicious or unwanted websites.
