FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring files over the internet. It was one of the earliest protocols developed for the internet and is still in use today.

FTP works by establishing a connection between a client (such as a computer running an FTP client program) and a server (which hosts the files to be transferred). The client sends a request to the server, asking to download or upload a specific file, and the server responds by sending or receiving the requested file.

FTP commands are sent over a control connection, which is separate from the data connection used to transfer the files. The control connection is used to send commands such as authentication, directory navigation, and file transfer commands. The data connection is used to actually transfer the files.

FTP has a number of security issues, including the transmission of passwords in plain text and the ability for attackers to intercept and modify data being transferred. As a result, it is often used in conjunction with other protocols such as SSL/TLS or SSH to provide encryption and authentication.

There are many FTP client programs available for a variety of operating systems, including FileZilla, Cyberduck, and WinSCP. FTP servers can be run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
