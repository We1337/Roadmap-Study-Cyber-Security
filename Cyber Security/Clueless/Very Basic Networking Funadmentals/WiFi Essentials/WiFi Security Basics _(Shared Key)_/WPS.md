Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is a feature designed to simplify the process of connecting devices to a Wi-Fi network. It allows users to connect to a wireless network by simply pressing a button or entering a PIN, instead of manually entering the network name (SSID) and password.

WPS is supported by most modern Wi-Fi routers and client devices, including smartphones, laptops, and printers. There are two methods of connecting devices using WPS: the push-button method and the PIN method.

The push-button method requires the user to press the WPS button on the router and then press the WPS button on the client device within two minutes. This method is easy to use and does not require the user to enter any passwords or network settings.

The PIN method requires the user to enter a PIN code generated by the router into the client device. The PIN can be found on a label on the router or can be generated using the router's web interface. This method is more secure than the push-button method, as it requires the user to enter a unique PIN code for each device.

However, WPS has been found to have several security vulnerabilities, including a brute-force attack that can be used to guess the PIN and gain access to the network. As a result, it is recommended to disable WPS on your Wi-Fi router to prevent potential security threats. If your router does not allow you to disable WPS, it is recommended to use the PIN method instead of the push-button method for connecting devices.
