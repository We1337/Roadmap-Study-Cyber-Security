Wi-Fi networks operate on radio frequencies that are designated by the IEEE for use in wireless communications. The most commonly used Wi-Fi frequencies are:

1. 2.4 GHz: This is the most widely used frequency for Wi-Fi networks. It provides coverage over a larger area and is compatible with a wide range of devices. However, because it is also used by other wireless devices such as Bluetooth and microwaves, interference can be a problem.
2. 5 GHz: This frequency is less crowded than 2.4 GHz and provides higher data rates, but has a shorter range and is less compatible with older devices.
3. 6 GHz: This is a relatively new frequency band that has been recently approved for use by the FCC. It provides faster speeds and less interference than the other bands but requires devices that support the newer Wi-Fi 6E standard.

In addition to these frequencies, there are also several sub-frequencies within each band, known as channels. These channels are used to divide the frequency band into smaller segments to minimize interference and increase the number of devices that can be connected to the network.

It is important to note that the specific frequency or channel used by a Wi-Fi network can vary depending on the country or region. Regulatory agencies such as the FCC in the United States and the ETSI in Europe allocate and manage the frequency bands used by Wi-Fi networks to avoid interference with other wireless devices and to ensure the safety of users.
