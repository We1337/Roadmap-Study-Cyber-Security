802.11 is a family of wireless network standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). These standards define the specifications for wireless local area networks (WLANs) that use radio waves to provide wireless connectivity between devices.

Here are some of the key standards within the 802.11 family:

1. 802.11a: This standard was released in 1999 and operates in the 5 GHz frequency band, providing higher data rates than previous 802.11 standards. However, due to the higher frequency, 802.11a has a shorter range than other 802.11 standards.
2. 802.11b: This standard was released in 1999 and operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, providing data rates up to 11 Mbps. 802.11b has a longer range than 802.11a but has a slower data rate.
3. 802.11g: This standard was released in 2003 and operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band, providing data rates up to 54 Mbps. 802.11g is backwards compatible with 802.11b.
4. 802.11n: This standard was released in 2009 and operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, providing data rates up to 600 Mbps. 802.11n uses multiple antennas and MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology to improve range and throughput.
5. 802.11ac: This standard was released in 2013 and operates in the 5 GHz frequency band, providing data rates up to 6.9 Gbps. 802.11ac uses wider channel bandwidths and MU-MIMO (multi-user multiple-input multiple-output) technology to improve range and throughput.
6. 802.11ax: This standard was released in 2019 and operates in both the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, providing data rates up to 10 Gbps. 802.11ax uses OFDMA (orthogonal frequency-division multiple access) and MU-MIMO technology to improve efficiency and network capacity.

Overall, the 802.11 family of wireless network standards has evolved over time to provide higher data rates, longer range, and improved efficiency. By understanding the different standards within the 802.11 family, users can choose the appropriate wireless technology to meet their networking needs.
