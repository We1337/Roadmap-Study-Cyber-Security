Port 23 is used by the Telnet protocol, which is a network protocol used to establish a remote shell session on a networked device. Telnet allows a user to log in to a remote device and execute commands as if they were sitting at the device's console.

When a user initiates a Telnet connection to a remote device, the Telnet client establishes a connection to the Telnet server on port 23. The server then prompts the user to enter their username and password. Once the user is authenticated, they can execute commands remotely.

Telnet is an older protocol that has largely been replaced by more secure protocols like SSH. One of the main drawbacks of Telnet is that it sends data in clear text, which can be intercepted by attackers. Because of this, Telnet is considered to be insecure and is generally not recommended for use over untrusted networks like the Internet.
