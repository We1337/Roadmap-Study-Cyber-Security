Port 445 is used by the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol.

SMB is a network protocol used by Windows operating systems for sharing files, printers, and other resources over a network. When a user accesses a file or printer on a remote computer using SMB, their computer sends an SMB request over port 445 to the remote computer. The remote computer responds with an SMB response containing the requested information or an error message if the operation failed.

SMB is widely used in enterprise networks for sharing files and resources among computers running different operating systems. While SMB provides powerful capabilities for sharing resources, it can also introduce security risks if not configured properly. In particular, SMB has been the target of numerous security vulnerabilities and attacks, including the notorious WannaCry ransomware attack that exploited a vulnerability in SMB to spread across networks. To address these issues, Microsoft has released numerous security updates and recommended best practices for securing SMB deployments.
