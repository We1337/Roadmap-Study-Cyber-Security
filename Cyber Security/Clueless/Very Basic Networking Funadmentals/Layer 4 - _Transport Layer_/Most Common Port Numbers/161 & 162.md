Ports 161 and 162 are used by the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).

SNMP is a protocol used to manage and monitor network devices, such as routers, switches, and servers. It allows network administrators to collect information about the status and performance of network devices, as well as configure and control them remotely.

When a network administrator wants to monitor a device using SNMP, they configure the device to send SNMP messages to a network management system (NMS) at a specific IP address and port. The NMS listens on port 162 for SNMP traps, which are unsolicited messages sent by devices to report events such as equipment failures or security breaches. The NMS can also send SNMP queries to devices on port 161 to request specific information about their status and performance.

SNMP is widely used in enterprise networks to manage and monitor network infrastructure. While SNMP provides a powerful set of tools for managing networks, it can also introduce security risks if not configured properly. SNMP messages are transmitted in clear text, which means that they can be intercepted and read by attackers. To address this issue, SNMP version 3 includes features for encryption and authentication to ensure the security of SNMP communications.
