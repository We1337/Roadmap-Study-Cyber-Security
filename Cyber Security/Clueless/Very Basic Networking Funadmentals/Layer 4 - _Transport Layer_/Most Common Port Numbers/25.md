Port 25 is used by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which is a protocol used to send email messages between servers. SMTP is a text-based protocol that defines how email messages are exchanged over the Internet.

When a user sends an email message, their email client connects to their email server on port 25 and initiates an SMTP session. The server then performs a series of handshakes with the recipient's email server to establish a connection and exchange information about the message being sent. Once the message is accepted by the recipient's email server, it is stored in the recipient's mailbox for retrieval by their email client.

SMTP is used by email servers to communicate with each other and exchange messages. While SMTP is a widely used protocol, it has some security weaknesses. For example, SMTP does not provide encryption, which means that email messages can be intercepted and read by attackers. To address this weakness, protocols like SMTPS and STARTTLS have been developed to provide encryption for SMTP sessions.
