Port 22 is used by the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol, which is a cryptographic network protocol used to establish secure communication channels over unsecured networks.

SSH provides secure access to a remote device or server, allowing users to log in and execute commands remotely. SSH uses encryption to protect data in transit, making it much more secure than protocols like Telnet, which send data in clear text.

When a user initiates an SSH connection to a remote device, the SSH client establishes a connection to the SSH server on port 22. The server then authenticates the user and establishes an encrypted communication channel over which the user can send commands and receive output.

SSH is commonly used by system administrators and developers to remotely manage servers and devices, transfer files securely, and tunnel other protocols over the encrypted SSH connection. SSH can also be used as a secure alternative to Telnet and other insecure remote access protocols.
