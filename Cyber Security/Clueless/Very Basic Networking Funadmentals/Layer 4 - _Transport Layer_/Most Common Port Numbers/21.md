Port 21 is used by the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to transfer files over a network. FTP is a standard protocol used to transfer files from one host to another over the Internet or other networks.

When an FTP client initiates a file transfer request, it establishes a control connection to the FTP server on port 21. The client and server then negotiate the mode of transfer, the type of data being transferred, and other parameters. Once the parameters have been negotiated, the client sends the file transfer request to the server.

FTP can use two modes of transfer: ASCII mode and binary mode. ASCII mode is used for text files, while binary mode is used for non-text files such as images, audio, and video.

While FTP is still widely used for file transfer, it is considered to be an insecure protocol because it sends usernames and passwords in plain text, which can be intercepted by attackers. For secure file transfers, it is recommended to use protocols such as Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) or File Transfer Protocol Secure (FTPS), which use encryption to protect data in transit.
