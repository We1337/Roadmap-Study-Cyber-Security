Port 389 is used by the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).

LDAP is a protocol used to access and manage information in directory services, such as Microsoft Active Directory or OpenLDAP. Directory services provide a hierarchical, tree-like structure for storing information, such as user accounts, group memberships, and other network resources.

LDAP allows clients to perform queries and updates to the directory service, as well as authenticate users and manage security permissions. When a client wants to perform an LDAP operation, it sends an LDAP request to the directory service over port 389. The directory service responds with an LDAP response containing the requested information or an error message if the operation failed.

LDAP is widely used in enterprise networks for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization. It provides a flexible, standards-based approach to managing directory information that can be used by a wide variety of applications and services. While LDAP provides powerful capabilities for managing network resources, it can also introduce security risks if not configured properly. To address this issue, LDAP implementations typically include features for authentication, encryption, and access control to ensure the security of directory information.
