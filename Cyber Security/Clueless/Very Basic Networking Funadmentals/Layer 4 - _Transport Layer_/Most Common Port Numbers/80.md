Port 80 is used by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is the protocol used for transferring web pages over the Internet.

When a user types a URL into their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server hosting the website. The web server responds with the requested web page, which the browser then displays to the user.

HTTP is a text-based protocol that defines how web browsers and web servers communicate with each other. HTTP requests and responses consist of headers and, optionally, a message body that contains the data being transmitted.

HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used for a wide variety of applications, including web browsing, web-based file sharing, and web services. In recent years, HTTPS (HTTP Secure), which uses encryption to provide a secure, private communication channel between web browsers and web servers, has become the preferred protocol for transmitting sensitive information over the web.
