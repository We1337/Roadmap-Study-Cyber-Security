UDP port 53 is used by the Domain Name System (DNS) protocol. DNS is a protocol used to translate human-readable domain names (like [www.example.com](http://www.example.com)) into IP addresses that computers can use to communicate with each other.

When a user enters a domain name into their web browser, the browser sends a DNS query to a DNS server to look up the IP address associated with that domain name. The DNS server responds to the query with the IP address, allowing the browser to connect to the website.

DNS queries are typically sent using either the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) or the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). UDP is used for simple DNS queries that can fit within a single packet, while TCP is used for larger queries that require multiple packets.

UDP port 53 is used for DNS queries and responses that can fit within a single packet. When a DNS query is sent using UDP, the client sends the query to the DNS server on port 53, and the server responds with the IP address associated with the domain name.

Because UDP does not provide reliable, ordered delivery of packets, DNS queries and responses can sometimes be lost or corrupted. To address this issue, DNS uses a variety of techniques to ensure that queries and responses are reliably delivered, including retrying failed queries, caching responses, and using redundant servers.
