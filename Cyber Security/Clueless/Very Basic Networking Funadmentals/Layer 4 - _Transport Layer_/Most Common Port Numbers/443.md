Port 443 is used by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS).

HTTPS is a protocol used to provide secure, encrypted communication between web browsers and web servers. When a user visits a website using HTTPS, their browser establishes a secure, encrypted connection to the web server using SSL/TLS encryption. This prevents attackers from intercepting and reading the data being transmitted between the user and the website.

HTTPS is widely used for e-commerce, online banking, and other applications that require secure communication over the internet. In recent years, HTTPS has become the preferred protocol for transmitting sensitive information over the web, as it provides a high level of security and privacy for both users and web applications.

In addition to encrypting data being transmitted over the internet, HTTPS also verifies the identity of the web server to ensure that the user is communicating with the intended website and not an impostor. This is done using digital certificates issued by trusted third-party certificate authorities (CAs). When a user connects to a website using HTTPS, their browser checks the digital certificate presented by the web server to verify that it was issued by a trusted CA and that the domain name in the certificate matches the domain name in the website's URL.
