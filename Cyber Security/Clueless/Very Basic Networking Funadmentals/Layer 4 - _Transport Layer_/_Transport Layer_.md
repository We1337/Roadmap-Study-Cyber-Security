The Transport Layer is the fourth layer in the OSI model and is responsible for providing reliable data transfer between processes or applications running on different devices. The Transport Layer protocols ensure that data is delivered correctly, completely, and in the right order.

There are two main protocols used at the Transport Layer: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP).

TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data transfer. TCP sets up a connection between two endpoints before data transfer begins and uses a three-way handshake to establish the connection. TCP provides features such as flow control, congestion control, and error detection and correction to ensure that data is delivered correctly and completely.

UDP, on the other hand, is a connectionless, unreliable protocol that is simpler than TCP. UDP is often used for real-time applications that require low latency, such as online gaming or video streaming. Because UDP does not provide any reliability mechanisms, it is faster than TCP but also less reliable.

Both TCP and UDP use port numbers to identify the application or process running on each device. Port numbers are used to multiplex multiple applications running on the same device and to demultiplex incoming data at the receiving end.

Overall, the Transport Layer plays a critical role in ensuring that data is delivered reliably and efficiently between applications or processes running on different devices.
