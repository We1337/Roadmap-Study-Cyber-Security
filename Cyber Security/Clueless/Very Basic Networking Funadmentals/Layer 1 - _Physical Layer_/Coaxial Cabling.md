Coaxial cabling, also known as coax, is a type of cable that is commonly used for transmitting high-frequency electrical signals, such as those used for cable TV, internet, and video signals. Coaxial cabling consists of a central conductor wire, surrounded by an insulating layer, a metallic shield, and a protective outer jacket.

The central conductor wire is usually made of copper and carries the electrical signal. It is surrounded by an insulating layer made of plastic or foam, which helps to keep the signal intact and prevent interference from outside sources.

The metallic shield is usually made of braided copper or aluminum and serves to protect the central conductor from electromagnetic interference and signal loss. The shield is also grounded to prevent the cable from carrying unwanted electrical signals.

The outer jacket is a protective layer made of PVC or other materials that provide mechanical protection and insulation for the cable.

Coaxial cabling comes in different types, each with different specifications for bandwidth and frequency range. The most common types are RG6 and RG11, which are used for cable TV and internet connections. RG6 is the more common of the two and can handle frequencies up to 3 GHz, while RG11 can handle frequencies up to 10 GHz and is often used for long-distance connections.

Overall, coaxial cabling is a reliable and efficient way to transmit high-frequency signals over long distances, making it a popular choice for cable TV and internet providers.
