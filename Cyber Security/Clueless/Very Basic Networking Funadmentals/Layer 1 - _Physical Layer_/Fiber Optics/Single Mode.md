Single-mode fiber is a type of optical fiber that has a small core diameter and allows for the transmission of a single mode of light. The core of a single-mode fiber is typically around 9 microns in diameter, which is much smaller than the core diameter of multi-mode fiber (which can range from 50 to 100 microns).

The small core diameter of single-mode fiber allows for a higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances compared to multi-mode fiber. Single-mode fiber can transmit data at higher speeds and over longer distances without the need for signal regeneration or amplification.

Single-mode fiber works by using a laser as a light source that emits a narrow beam of light, which travels down the center of the fiber core. The light beam is guided by the fiber's cladding layer, which reflects the light back into the core, preventing it from escaping. This results in minimal signal loss and allows the light to travel long distances without significant degradation.

Single-mode fiber is commonly used in long-distance telecommunications, such as for submarine communications cables and intercontinental network connections. It is also used in high-speed data transmission applications, such as in data centers, and in scientific and industrial applications that require high precision and reliability.

While single-mode fiber has many advantages, it is also more expensive than multi-mode fiber due to its manufacturing process and the need for more precise components.
