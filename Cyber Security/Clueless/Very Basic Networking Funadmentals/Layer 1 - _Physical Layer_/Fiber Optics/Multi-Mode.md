Multi-mode fiber is a type of optical fiber that has a larger core diameter compared to single-mode fiber, typically ranging from 50 to 100 microns. The larger core diameter allows for the transmission of multiple modes of light, which can travel down the fiber at different angles and speeds.

Multi-mode fiber uses a light source, typically an LED, to generate a wider beam of light that can be transmitted over the fiber. The light beam is guided by the fiber's cladding layer, which reflects the light back into the core, preventing it from escaping.

Multi-mode fiber is commonly used in short-distance data transmission applications, such as local area networks (LANs) and data centers, where high bandwidth and low cost are important factors. It is also used in audio and video applications, such as in home entertainment systems.

One of the disadvantages of multi-mode fiber is that it suffers from modal dispersion, which means that the different modes of light travel at slightly different speeds and arrive at different times. This can cause signal distortion and limit the transmission distance and bandwidth of the fiber.

To overcome the modal dispersion issue, multi-mode fiber is often designed with graded index or stepped index profiles, which help to reduce the difference in travel times between the different modes of light. These types of multi-mode fibers are called graded index multi-mode fiber (GI-MMF) and stepped index multi-mode fiber (SI-MMF), respectively.

Overall, multi-mode fiber is a cost-effective option for short-distance data transmission applications, while single-mode fiber is better suited for longer distance and higher bandwidth applications.
