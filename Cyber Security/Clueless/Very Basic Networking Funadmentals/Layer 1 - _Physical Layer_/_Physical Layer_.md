The Physical Layer is the first layer of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model and is responsible for the transmission of raw bit stream over a physical medium, such as a copper cable, fiber optic cable, or wireless channel.

The main functions of the Physical Layer include encoding and decoding of data bits, modulation and demodulation of signals, and physical transmission of signals over the medium.

Encoding involves converting the digital bits of data into a format that can be transmitted over the physical medium, such as NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) encoding, Manchester encoding, or 4B/5B encoding.

Modulation involves converting the encoded digital signal into an analog signal that can be transmitted over the physical medium. Examples of modulation techniques include Amplitude Modulation (AM), Frequency Modulation (FM), and Phase Modulation (PM).

Demodulation is the reverse process of modulation, in which the analog signal received over the medium is converted back into a digital signal that can be interpreted by the receiver.

Physical transmission involves the actual movement of the signal over the physical medium. This can include transmitting the signal through copper or fiber optic cables, or broadcasting the signal over the air using wireless technologies such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.

Overall, the Physical Layer is responsible for ensuring that the transmitted signal is received with the correct bit sequence and at an appropriate signal strength, while minimizing noise and interference from other sources on the medium.
