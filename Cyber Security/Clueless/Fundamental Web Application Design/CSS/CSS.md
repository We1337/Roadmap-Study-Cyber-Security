CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, and is used to add styling and formatting to web pages written in HTML and XML. CSS provides a way to separate the presentation of a web page from its content, allowing developers to create visually appealing websites that are easy to maintain and update.

Here are some basic concepts related to CSS:

- **Selectors**: CSS selectors are used to target HTML elements and apply styles to them. There are many different types of selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, and ID selectors.
- **Properties**: CSS properties are used to define the styles that should be applied to the selected elements. Properties can include things like font size, color, background color, and more.
- **Values**: CSS values are used to define the specific settings for a given property. For example, the font-size property could be set to a value of 16px, 1em, or small.
- **Box model**: The CSS box model refers to the way that elements are sized and positioned on a web page. Every element has a content area, padding, borders, and margins, which can all be styled separately.
- **Layout**: CSS provides many tools for creating complex page layouts, including display types, positioning, and float properties. These tools allow developers to create multi-column designs, fixed or fluid layouts, and more.
- **Media queries**: Media queries allow developers to create styles that are specific to certain screen sizes or devices. This allows for the creation of responsive web designs that look good on all types of devices.

CSS can be added to a web page in a variety of ways, including inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets. External stylesheets are generally considered the best practice, as they allow for easy reuse of styles across multiple pages, and make it easy to update the styles for an entire website in one place.
