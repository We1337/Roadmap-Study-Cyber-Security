A WordPress coder is a professional who specializes in writing code for WordPress websites, themes, and plugins. This may include front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as back-end development using PHP and MySQL. WordPress coders are responsible for creating custom WordPress themes and plugins, as well as modifying existing themes and plugins to meet specific requirements.

WordPress coders must have a strong understanding of WordPress core functionality and be familiar with WordPress coding standards and best practices. They should be able to work with popular WordPress development tools such as the WordPress Codex, WordPress APIs, and the WordPress Plugin Handbook. They may also work with popular WordPress development frameworks and libraries, such as Bootstrap, Foundation, and Underscores.

In addition to coding skills, WordPress coders must have strong problem-solving and communication skills, as they often work closely with clients or team members to understand project requirements and troubleshoot issues. They may work as freelancers, contractors, or in-house developers for organizations that use WordPress as their content management system.
