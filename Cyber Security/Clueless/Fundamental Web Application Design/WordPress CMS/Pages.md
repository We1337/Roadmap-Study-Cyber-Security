In the context of a content management system like WordPress, a page is a type of content that represents a static piece of information on a website. Pages are typically used for content that doesn't change frequently, such as an "About Us" or "Contact" page.

Pages in WordPress are distinct from posts, which are used for dynamic content that is typically displayed in reverse chronological order on a site's homepage or blog section.

Creating a new page in WordPress is simple:

1. Log in to the WordPress dashboard and click on "Pages" in the left-hand menu.
2. Click on the "Add New" button at the top of the page.
3. Enter a title for your page in the title field.
4. Enter your content in the main content area using the WordPress editor, which allows you to add text, images, and other media to your page.
5. Customize your page using the options in the right-hand sidebar, including page attributes (e.g. parent page, template), featured image, and page visibility settings.

Once you've created your page, you can publish it immediately or save it as a draft for later. Pages can be edited or deleted at any time, and you can also organize them into a hierarchical structure by setting parent and child pages.

In addition to the standard page template, WordPress also allows you to create custom page templates that can be used to display different types of content or apply unique styles to specific pages. Custom page templates can be created by adding PHP code to a new template file in your theme folder, and then selecting that template from the Page Attributes section when editing a page.
