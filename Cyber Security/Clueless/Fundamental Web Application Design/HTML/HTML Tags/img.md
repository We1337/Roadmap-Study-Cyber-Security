The `<img>` tag is an HTML tag used to insert an image into a web page. It is a self-closing tag, which means that it does not require a closing tag.

The `<img>` tag requires a `src` attribute, which specifies the URL of the image file to be displayed. The `alt` attribute is also recommended, as it provides alternative text for the image in case it cannot be displayed.

Here is an example of how the `<img>` tag is used:

```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful sunset">
```

In this example, the `<img>` tag is used to display an image with a filename of "image.jpg" and an alternative text of "A beautiful sunset". The image file must be located in the same directory as the HTML file, or a full URL to the image file must be specified in the `src` attribute.

The `<img>` tag also supports other attributes, such as `width`, `height`, and `title`, which can be used to further customize the appearance and behavior of the image.
