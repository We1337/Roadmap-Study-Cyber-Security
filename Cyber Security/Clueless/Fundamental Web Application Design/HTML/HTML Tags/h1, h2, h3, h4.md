`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` are HTML tags used to create headings in a web page. These tags are part of the HTML heading structure, with `<h1>` being the largest and most important heading, and `<h4>` being the smallest and least important heading.

Here is an example of how the heading tags can be used:

```html
<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>This is some information about me.</p>
<h2>Services</h2>
<p>These are the services I offer.</p>
<h3>Service 1</h3>
<p>Details about Service 1.</p>
<h3>Service 2</h3>
<p>Details about Service 2.</p>
<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>Here's how to get in touch with me.</p>
```

In this example, the `<h1>` tag is used to create the main heading of the page, while `<h2>` tags are used to create subheadings for the About, Services, and Contact sections. The `<h3>` tag is used to create subheadings for the individual services within the Services section.

By default, headings are displayed in bold and with larger font sizes than regular text. However, the appearance of headings can be customized with CSS to match the design of the web page.
