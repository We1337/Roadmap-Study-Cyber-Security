The `<p>` tag in HTML stands for "paragraph" and is used to define a block of text that forms a paragraph. It has the following syntax:

```html
<p>paragraph text</p>
```

The text that appears between the opening and closing `<p>` tags is the content of the paragraph. By default, the text is displayed with a blank line above and below it, which separates it visually from other content on the page.

The `<p>` tag is one of the most commonly used tags in HTML and is used to create the main body text of a web page. It can be used to create multiple paragraphs of text on a page, with each paragraph enclosed in its own set of `<p>` tags.

For example, to create two paragraphs of text, you would use the following code:

```html
<p>Paragraph 1 text goes here...</p>
<p>Paragraph 2 text goes here...</p>
```

When this code is rendered in a web browser, it will display the two paragraphs of text, with a blank line separating them.
