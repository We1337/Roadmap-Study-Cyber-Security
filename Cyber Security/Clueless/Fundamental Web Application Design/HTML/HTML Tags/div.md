`<div>` is an HTML tag used to create a container element that can be used to group other HTML elements together and apply styles or JavaScript functionality to them as a group. The `<div>` tag is often used with CSS to create layouts for web pages.

Here is an example of how the `<div>` tag is used to create a container element:

```html
<div>
  <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="An image">
</div>
```

In this example, the `<div>` tag is used to create a container that groups together a heading, a paragraph, and an image. CSS styles can be applied to this container element to adjust its positioning, background color, or other properties.

The `<div>` tag is a block-level element, which means it takes up the full width of its parent container by default and forces any subsequent elements to appear on a new line. It can be styled with CSS to adjust its size, position, or other properties.
