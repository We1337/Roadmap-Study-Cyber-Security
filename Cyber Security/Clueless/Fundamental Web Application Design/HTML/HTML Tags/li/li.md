`<li>` is an HTML tag used to define a list item. It is commonly used within ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists to define each individual item in the list. Here is an example of how the `<li>` tag is used within an unordered list:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
```

In this example, the `<li>` tag is used to define each item in an unordered list. The resulting list will be rendered in a web browser with each item on a new line and with a bullet point or other marker preceding each item.

The `<li>` tag can also be used outside of lists, but it is not common practice and is not considered valid HTML.
