`<html>`, `<body>`, and `<head>` are three fundamental tags in HTML, each serving a specific purpose:

- `<html>`: This tag is used to define the beginning and end of an HTML document. It contains all the other tags that define the structure and content of the document.
- `<body>`: This tag is used to define the main content of an HTML document, such as paragraphs, headings, images, links, and so on. All the visible content that appears on a web page is defined within the `<body>` tag.
- `<head>`: This tag is used to define the metadata of an HTML document, such as the title of the page, links to CSS files, scripts, and other resources. The contents of the `<head>` tag are not displayed on the web page, but are used by the browser and search engines to understand and index the page.

Together, these three tags define the basic structure of an HTML document, with the `<head>` tag providing information about the document, the `<body>` tag providing the visible content, and the `<html>` tag enclosing everything.
