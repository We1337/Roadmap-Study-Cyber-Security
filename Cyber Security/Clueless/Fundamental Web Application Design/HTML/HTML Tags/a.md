The `<a>` tag in HTML stands for "anchor" and is used to create hyperlinks to other web pages or to specific parts of a web page. It has the following syntax:

```html
<a href="url">link text</a>
```

The `href` attribute specifies the URL (web address) of the page that the link goes to. This can be a relative or absolute URL. The link text is the text that appears on the web page and is used to indicate to the user where the link will take them.

For example, to create a link to the Google homepage, you would use the following code:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Go to Google</a>
```

When a user clicks on the link, their browser will open the Google homepage.

In addition to linking to other web pages, the `<a>` tag can also be used to link to specific parts of a web page using the `id` attribute. For example:

```html
<h2 id="section1">Section 1</h2>
<p>Some content in section 1...</p>

<a href="#section1">Go to section 1</a>
```

In this example, the `id` attribute is used to give the `<h2>` tag a unique identifier, which is then used in the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag to link to that specific section of the page. When the user clicks on the link, their browser will scroll down to the specified section of the page.
