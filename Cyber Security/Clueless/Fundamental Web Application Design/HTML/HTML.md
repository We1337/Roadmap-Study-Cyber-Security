HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages and applications. It is the foundation of all web pages and provides the structure and content of the page.

HTML consists of a series of tags that define the elements and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and typically come in pairs with an opening tag and a closing tag. The content between the tags is what appears on the web page.

HTML is used to structure web content, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links. It can also be used to add multimedia elements, such as videos, audio, and animations. HTML also allows for the creation of forms for user input and interaction.

HTML is a widely used language and is supported by all modern web browsers. As the internet has evolved, HTML has continued to develop and new versions of the language, such as HTML5, have been released to keep up with the changing needs of web development.
