ARM (Advanced RISC Machines) is a British semiconductor and software design company that specializes in designing and licensing CPU architectures. ARM processors, also known as ARM-based processors or ARM CPUs, are used in a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, embedded systems, IoT (Internet of Things) devices, servers, and more. ARM processors are known for their low power consumption, high performance per watt, and scalability, which make them suitable for a wide range of applications.

ARM processors come in various series and models, each catering to different market segments and use cases. Here are some of the main series of ARM processors:

1. ARM Cortex-A: The Cortex-A series is designed for high-performance applications, such as smartphones, tablets, and servers. Cortex-A processors offer multiple cores, high clock speeds, and advanced features like out-of-order execution, branch prediction, and hardware virtualization. They are optimized for performance and power efficiency, making them suitable for devices that require high computing power while managing power consumption.
2. ARM Cortex-R: The Cortex-R series is designed for real-time applications, such as embedded systems, automotive systems, and industrial control. Cortex-R processors offer deterministic real-time performance with features like error correction, fault tolerance, and low-latency interrupt handling, making them suitable for applications that require strict timing and reliability requirements.
3. ARM Cortex-M: The Cortex-M series is designed for microcontroller applications, such as IoT devices, wearables, and embedded systems. Cortex-M processors are optimized for low power consumption and small form factors, and they offer features like low-power modes, efficient interrupt handling, and small code size, making them suitable for devices that require low power consumption and real-time performance with limited resources.

ARM processors are licensed to other semiconductor companies, which then manufacture and sell ARM-based chips under their own brand names. Some popular manufacturers of ARM-based processors include Qualcomm, MediaTek, Samsung, Apple, and NVIDIA, among others.

It's important to note that ARM processors use a different instruction set architecture (ISA) compared to x86 processors used by Intel and AMD CPUs. As a result, software and operating systems designed for x86 processors may not be compatible with ARM processors without proper emulation or translation. However, ARM processors have gained widespread adoption in many devices due to their power efficiency, performance, and versatility, and they are a dominant force in the mobile and embedded systems markets.
