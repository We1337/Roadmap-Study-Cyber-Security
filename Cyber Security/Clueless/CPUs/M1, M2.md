M1 and M2 are system-on-chip (SoC) processors developed by Apple Inc. for use in their Mac computers.

1. M1: The M1 chip, also known as Apple Silicon M1, is the first SoC processor designed by Apple specifically for Mac computers. It was announced in November 2020 and first introduced in the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini in late 2020. The M1 chip features an 8-core CPU, an 8-core GPU, a 16-core Neural Engine, and a unified memory architecture that combines high-bandwidth, low-latency memory and storage on a single chip. It is based on ARM architecture and is fabricated using a 5-nanometer process technology. The M1 chip is known for its high performance, power efficiency, and integration of various components onto a single chip, enabling improved performance and battery life in Apple's Mac computers.
2. M2 (unofficial name): The M2 chip, also known as Apple Silicon M2 (unofficial name), is the successor to the M1 chip and is expected to be released in the future. As of the knowledge cutoff date of this model (September 2021), Apple has not officially announced or released any information about the M2 chip. However, it is widely speculated that the M2 chip will likely build on the success of the M1 chip, offering even higher performance, improved power efficiency, and additional features for Apple's future Mac computers. The M2 chip is expected to be based on ARM architecture and fabricated using an advanced process technology, likely 5-nanometer or smaller.

It's important to note that as with any upcoming technology, details about the M2 chip are subject to change until officially announced and released by Apple. More information about the M2 chip is expected to be revealed by Apple in the future as they continue to innovate and develop new processors for their Mac lineup.
