A Trojan, short for Trojan horse, is a type of malicious software that is designed to look like a legitimate program but actually contains harmful code. Trojans can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, monitoring user activity, or conducting further attacks on the victim's network.

Trojans are typically spread through email attachments, infected websites, or malicious software downloads. Once installed on a victim's system, a Trojan may perform a variety of actions without the user's knowledge, such as opening a backdoor to allow remote access by an attacker, modifying or deleting files, or installing additional malware.

Trojans can be difficult to detect, as they often operate silently in the background without the user's knowledge. Some signs of a Trojan infection may include slow system performance, unusual pop-up messages, or unexpected changes to system settings.

To protect against Trojans, it is important to use reputable antivirus software and to keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. Users should also avoid downloading software or attachments from untrusted sources and use caution when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. It is also a good practice to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts.
