A worm is a type of malware that can self-replicate and spread across networks without requiring a host program or user interaction. Worms can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, monitoring user activity, or conducting further attacks on the victim's network.

Worms are typically spread through network vulnerabilities or by tricking users into downloading and executing infected files. Once a worm infects a system, it can scan for and infect other vulnerable systems on the same network, leading to a rapid spread of the malware.

Worms can be difficult to detect and remove, as they often operate silently in the background without the user's knowledge. Some signs of a worm infection may include unusual network activity, slow system performance, or unexpected pop-up windows.

To protect against worms, it is important to use reputable antivirus software and to keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. Users should also avoid downloading software or attachments from untrusted sources and use caution when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. It is also a good practice to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts. Additionally, organizations can implement network segmentation and firewalls to limit the spread of worms across their networks.
