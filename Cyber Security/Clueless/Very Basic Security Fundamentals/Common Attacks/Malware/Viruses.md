A computer virus is a type of malware that is designed to replicate itself by inserting its code into other programs, files, or the boot sector of a hard drive. Once installed on a victim's system, a virus can cause a variety of harmful effects, such as stealing sensitive information, corrupting files, or disrupting system operations.

Viruses are typically spread through infected email attachments, infected software downloads, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in a system's security. Once a virus infects a system, it can replicate and spread to other systems and devices through various means.

Viruses can be difficult to detect and remove, as they often operate silently in the background without the user's knowledge. Some signs of a virus infection may include slow system performance, unexpected error messages, or the appearance of unusual files or folders on the system.

To protect against viruses, it is important to use reputable antivirus software and to keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. Users should also avoid downloading software or attachments from untrusted sources and use caution when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. It is also a good practice to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts. Additionally, organizations can implement network segmentation and firewalls to limit the spread of viruses across their networks.
