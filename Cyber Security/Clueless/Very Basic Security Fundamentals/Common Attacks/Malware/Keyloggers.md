Keyloggers are a type of software or hardware device that records every keystroke entered on a computer or mobile device. Keyloggers can be used for legitimate purposes, such as monitoring employee activity or tracking children's online behavior, but they can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information like login credentials or financial data.

There are two main types of keyloggers: software-based and hardware-based. Software-based keyloggers are installed on a device as a program, often hidden within another application or disguised as a legitimate software update. Hardware-based keyloggers are physical devices that are attached to a computer or mobile device, often between the keyboard and the computer, and record keystrokes as they are entered.

Keyloggers can be difficult to detect, as they often operate silently in the background without the user's knowledge. Some signs of a keylogger infection may include slow system performance, unusual pop-up messages, or unexpected changes to system settings.

To protect against keyloggers, it is important to use reputable antivirus software and to keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. Users should also avoid downloading software or attachments from untrusted sources and use caution when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. It is also a good practice to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts.
