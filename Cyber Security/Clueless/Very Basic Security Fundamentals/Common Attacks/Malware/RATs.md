A Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is a type of malware that allows an attacker to remotely control a victim's computer or mobile device. RATs can be used for a variety of malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information, monitoring user activity, or conducting further attacks on the victim's network.

RATs are typically spread through email attachments, infected websites, or malicious software downloads. Once installed on a victim's system, a RAT will often establish a connection to a command and control server operated by the attacker, allowing them to remotely control the infected device.

RATs can be difficult to detect, as they often operate silently in the background without the user's knowledge. Some signs of a RAT infection may include unusual network activity, system crashes, or unexpected pop-up windows.

To protect against RATs, it is important to use reputable antivirus software and to keep all software and operating systems up-to-date with the latest security patches. Users should also avoid downloading software or attachments from untrusted sources and use caution when entering sensitive information such as passwords or financial data. It is also a good practice to use two-factor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security to sensitive accounts.
