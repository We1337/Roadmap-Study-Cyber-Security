Here are some common types of attacks that can be targeted against computer systems and networks:

1. Malware: Malware is malicious software that is designed to infiltrate a computer system or network and cause harm. It includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, ransomware, and adware.
2. Phishing: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where attackers send fraudulent emails, text messages, or phone calls to trick users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal data.
3. Denial of Service (DoS) attacks: A DoS attack is an attempt to make a website or network unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic or other types of requests, thereby making it difficult or impossible for legitimate users to access it.
4. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks: A MitM attack occurs when an attacker intercepts and alters communications between two parties, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive information or inject malicious content into the communication.
5. SQL Injection: SQL injection is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in web applications that do not properly validate user input. Attackers inject malicious SQL statements into web forms or other input fields, allowing them to access, modify or delete data in a database.
6. Cross-site Scripting (XSS): XSS is another attack that targets web applications. Attackers inject malicious code into web pages viewed by other users, allowing them to steal sensitive data or hijack user sessions.
7. Password attacks: Password attacks are attempts to obtain passwords through various means, such as brute force attacks, dictionary attacks, or social engineering techniques.
8. Insider attacks: Insider attacks are carried out by authorized users who misuse their access privileges to steal data or cause harm to a system or network.

These are just a few examples of the many types of attacks that can be launched against computer systems and networks. It is important for organizations to implement appropriate security measures to protect against these attacks and to remain vigilant in monitoring for new and emerging threats.
