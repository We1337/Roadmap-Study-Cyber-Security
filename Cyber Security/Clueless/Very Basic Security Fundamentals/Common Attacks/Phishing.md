Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where an attacker sends fraudulent emails or other communication that appears to come from a reputable source, such as a bank, social media site, or online retailer. The goal of the attack is to trick the recipient into providing sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or other personal information.

Phishing attacks typically involve creating a sense of urgency or fear to encourage the victim to act quickly without thinking critically. For example, the email might claim that there is a security issue with the victim's account and that they need to click on a link to verify their information. The link leads to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one, where the victim enters their login credentials and other personal information. The attacker can then use this information to gain access to the victim's account or commit identity theft.

Phishing attacks can take many forms, including:

1. Spear Phishing: The attacker targets specific individuals or organizations with tailored messages that appear to be legitimate.
2. Whaling: A type of spear phishing attack aimed at high-level executives or decision-makers within an organization.
3. Smishing: Phishing attacks that occur over SMS or text messages.
4. Vishing: Phishing attacks that occur over voice calls.  

To protect against phishing attacks, it is important to educate users on how to identify suspicious emails or messages, and to implement technical measures such as spam filters, anti-phishing software, and two-factor authentication. Users should be trained to look for red flags such as misspellings, suspicious links or attachments, and urgent or threatening language in emails or other communications. It is also important to verify the legitimacy of any requests for sensitive information by contacting the organization directly through a trusted channel.
