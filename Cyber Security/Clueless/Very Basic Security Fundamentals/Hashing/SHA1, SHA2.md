SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) and SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2) are cryptographic hash functions developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) in the United States. Both SHA-1 and SHA-2 take an input message of any length and produce a fixed-size output of 160 and 224, 256, 384, or 512 bits, respectively.

SHA-1 was introduced in 1995 as a replacement for MD5 and was widely used in a variety of applications, including digital signatures and data integrity verification. However, its security has been weakened over time due to advances in cryptanalysis, and it is no longer considered a secure hash function for cryptographic purposes.

SHA-2, on the other hand, is a family of hash functions that includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These hash functions are designed to be more secure than SHA-1 and have not been broken by cryptanalysis to date.

SHA-2 hash functions have several key properties, including:

- Determinism: For a given input message, the SHA-2 algorithm will always produce the same output hash value.  
- Compression: The input message is compressed before being processed by the hash function, resulting in a fixed-size output.  
- One-wayness: It is computationally infeasible to reverse engineer the input message from the output hash value.  
- Collision resistance: It is extremely difficult to find two different input messages that produce the same hash value.

SHA-2 is widely used in a variety of applications, including digital certificates, password storage, and data integrity verification. It is considered a secure and widely recommended hash function for cryptographic purposes.
