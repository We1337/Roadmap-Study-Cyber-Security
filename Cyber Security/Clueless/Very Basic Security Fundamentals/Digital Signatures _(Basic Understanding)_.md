A digital signature is a mathematical scheme used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and non-repudiation of electronic documents, messages, or transactions. It is a way to ensure that a document or message has not been tampered with or modified, and that the sender is who they claim to be.

Digital signatures use public key cryptography to create a unique digital fingerprint, or hash, of the document or message being signed. The sender uses their private key to encrypt the hash, which is then sent along with the document or message to the receiver. The receiver uses the sender's public key to decrypt the hash and compare it to a newly computed hash of the original document or message. If the two hashes match, the receiver can be confident that the document or message has not been tampered with, and that the sender is who they claim to be.

Digital signatures are widely used in a variety of applications, including electronic contracts, email, and financial transactions. They provide a way to securely and reliably verify the authenticity of electronic documents and messages, and to prevent fraud and tampering. They are also used to ensure non-repudiation, meaning that the sender cannot deny having sent the document or message, as the digital signature provides a verifiable proof of the sender's identity.
