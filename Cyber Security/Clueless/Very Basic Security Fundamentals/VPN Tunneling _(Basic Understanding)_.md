VPN tunneling is a technique used to create a secure and private connection, or tunnel, between two networks over the internet. The purpose of a VPN tunnel is to encrypt and protect data traffic flowing between the two networks, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring data confidentiality and integrity.

When a VPN tunnel is created, data is encapsulated within a secure and encrypted tunnel, which is then transmitted over the public internet. The process of tunneling involves the use of a VPN protocol, such as IPsec or SSL/TLS, which provides the encryption and security mechanisms necessary to protect the data.

There are two types of VPN tunneling: site-to-site and remote access. Site-to-site VPN tunneling is used to connect two or more networks together, while remote access VPN tunneling is used to connect individual users to a private network.

In site-to-site VPN tunneling, a VPN gateway or router is used to create the secure connection between two or more networks. The VPN gateway or router acts as an intermediary between the two networks, encapsulating and encrypting data traffic as it flows between them.

In remote access VPN tunneling, individual users connect to a VPN gateway or server over the internet. The VPN gateway or server authenticates the user and creates a secure tunnel for data traffic to flow between the user's device and the private network.

VPN tunneling is a powerful and widely used tool for securing internet communications and ensuring data privacy and security. It is commonly used by businesses, organizations, and individuals to protect sensitive data and prevent unauthorized access to private networks.
