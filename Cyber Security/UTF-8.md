UTF-8 (Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit) is a variable-length character encoding scheme that is widely used to represent text in modern computing systems. It is a way of encoding the Unicode character set, which encompasses a vast range of characters from different writing systems, including most of the world's languages.

UTF-8 uses variable-length encoding, which means that characters may be represented using different numbers of bytes depending on their Unicode code point value. UTF-8 is backward compatible with ASCII, meaning that ASCII characters (with code points 0 to 127) are encoded using a single byte in UTF-8, which makes UTF-8 compatible with ASCII-encoded text.

In UTF-8, characters with code points greater than 127 are represented using multi-byte sequences, where the number of bytes used to represent a character varies depending on the character's Unicode code point value. This allows UTF-8 to represent a wide range of characters while being efficient in terms of storage and transmission.

UTF-8 has become the most widely used character encoding scheme on the internet and is the default encoding used in many programming languages, operating systems, and file formats. It allows for the representation of text in different scripts, emojis, special characters, and other symbols from various languages, making it highly versatile for modern text-based communication and data processing.
