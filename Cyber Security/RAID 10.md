RAID 10, also known as RAID 1+0, is a combination of RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping) to provide both fault tolerance and performance. RAID 10 combines the best of both worlds, offering both high data protection and high performance.

In a RAID 10 array, data is mirrored across multiple pairs of disks (typically two disks per pair), and then the mirrored pairs are striped in a RAID 0 configuration. This means that data is duplicated across two or more disks for redundancy (mirroring), and then the duplicated data is striped across multiple disks for improved performance (striping).

The main advantages of RAID 10 are its high fault tolerance and excellent performance. RAID 10 can tolerate the failure of up to half of the disks in the array, as long as no two disks in the same mirrored pair fail simultaneously. This makes RAID 10 highly resilient to disk failures, ensuring that data remains available even in the event of multiple disk failures.

In terms of performance, RAID 10 can provide excellent read and write performance. Because data is striped across multiple disks, RAID 10 can deliver high data transfer rates, making it suitable for applications that require high throughput, such as databases, video editing, or virtualization environments. Additionally, RAID 10 does not suffer from the write performance overhead that is present in RAID 5 or RAID 6, as no parity calculations are required.

Another advantage of RAID 10 is its simplicity and ease of recovery. In case of a disk failure, the recovery process is straightforward as data is mirrored across multiple disks. Rebuilding a failed disk in a RAID 10 array is simply a matter of copying data from the remaining mirror to a new disk, which can be done relatively quickly.

However, RAID 10 also has some downsides. One main drawback is its lower storage efficiency compared to other RAID levels. RAID 10 requires mirroring of data, which means that only half of the total capacity of the array is usable for storing data, while the other half is used for mirroring. This results in lower storage efficiency compared to RAID levels like RAID 5 or RAID 6, where parity is used for redundancy instead of mirroring.

Another limitation of RAID 10 is its cost. RAID 10 requires a higher number of disks compared to other RAID levels, as data needs to be mirrored across multiple pairs of disks. This can result in higher costs for disk procurement and maintenance, especially for large-scale storage systems.

In summary, RAID 10 offers excellent fault tolerance and performance, making it suitable for applications that require high data protection and high performance. However, it has lower storage efficiency compared to some other RAID levels and can be more expensive in terms of disk requirements. Proper consideration of storage requirements, performance needs, and budget should be taken into account when implementing RAID 10 in a storage environment.
