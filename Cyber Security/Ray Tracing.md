Ray tracing is a rendering technique used in computer graphics to simulate the behavior of light as it interacts with objects in a scene. It is a computationally intensive technique that calculates the paths of individual rays of light, simulating their interactions with surfaces, reflections, refractions, and other optical phenomena, to generate realistic and visually appealing images.

In traditional rendering techniques, such as rasterization, objects in a scene are represented as a collection of polygons or other geometric primitives, and the rendering process involves projecting these primitives onto a 2D screen space and shading them to create the final image. However, ray tracing takes a different approach by simulating the path of light rays as they travel through the scene, interacting with objects and light sources to calculate the final color of each pixel in the image.

Ray tracing can produce high-quality, photorealistic images with accurate reflections, refractions, and global illumination effects that are difficult to achieve with traditional rendering techniques. It is widely used in various applications, including video games, movies, virtual reality, product design, architecture, and more, to create visually stunning and realistic graphics.

Ray tracing can be computationally demanding, as it involves tracing a large number of rays and calculating their interactions with objects in the scene, which requires substantial processing power. Recent advancements in hardware, such as dedicated ray tracing hardware in GPUs, have accelerated the adoption of real-time ray tracing in interactive applications, enabling more realistic and immersive visual experiences.

Ray tracing has become a popular and powerful technique in computer graphics, allowing for highly realistic rendering of light and reflections in virtual scenes, and it continues to be an area of active research and development in the field of computer graphics.
