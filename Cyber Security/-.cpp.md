".cpp" is a file extension used in C++ programming language to denote C++ source code files. C++ is a popular programming language that supports object-oriented programming (OOP) and is commonly used for developing system software, game engines, embedded systems, and other performance-critical applications. C++ source code files typically contain C++ code written using the syntax and features of the C++ programming language, and they can be compiled into executable files that can be run on a computer. C++ code files usually have the ".cpp" file extension, although they may also have other extensions such as ".cc", ".cxx", or ".c++".
