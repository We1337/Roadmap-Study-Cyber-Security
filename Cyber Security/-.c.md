The ".c" file extension is commonly used for C programming language files. C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language that is widely used for developing software applications, operating systems, embedded systems, and more.

Files with the ".c" extension typically contain C source code, which is a collection of instructions written in the C programming language that define the behavior of a computer program. C source code files can be created and edited using a text editor or specialized integrated development environments (IDEs) that provide features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools.

Once the C source code is written, it needs to be compiled into machine code, which is a low-level representation of the program that can be executed by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). The compiled machine code is typically stored in a separate file with an executable extension, such as ".exe" on Windows or without any extension on Unix-based systems. The compiled executable file can then be run on a computer to execute the program.

C source code files may also include header files (with a ".h" extension) that contain function prototypes, macros, and other declarations that are used across multiple source code files. These header files are typically included in the C source code files using preprocessor directives such as "#include".

The ".c" file extension is widely recognized and supported by various compilers and development environments for the C programming language, making it a common and standard file extension for C source code files.
