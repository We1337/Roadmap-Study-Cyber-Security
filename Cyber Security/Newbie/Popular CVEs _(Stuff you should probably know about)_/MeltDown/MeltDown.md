Meltdown is a computer vulnerability that affects modern microprocessors, including those from Intel, AMD, and ARM. It was publicly disclosed in January 2018 and is identified by CVE-2017-5754. Meltdown allows an attacker to bypass the isolation between user applications and the operating system, potentially accessing sensitive information from memory.

The vulnerability exploits a technique called speculative execution, which is used by modern processors to optimize performance. Speculative execution allows the processor to execute instructions ahead of time, even before it is certain that they will be needed. Meltdown specifically targets a side-channel information leakage in speculative execution.

By leveraging Meltdown, an attacker can access data from the memory of other processes running on the same system. This includes sensitive information like passwords, encryption keys, and personal data. The vulnerability essentially breaks the fundamental isolation provided by the operating system, allowing an unauthorized user to extract data from protected memory.

Meltdown was considered a significant security concern due to its potential impact on a wide range of systems, including desktops, servers, and cloud infrastructure. Operating system and hardware vendors quickly released patches and mitigations to address the vulnerability. These patches included changes to the operating system kernel, which prevent unauthorized access to kernel memory.

It's important to note that applying security updates and patches is crucial to protect against vulnerabilities like Meltdown. Regularly updating your operating system, firmware, and software applications helps ensure you have the latest protections against known vulnerabilities.

It's worth mentioning that the information provided here is based on my knowledge up until September 2021. It's always recommended to stay updated with the latest security advisories and follow best practices recommended by software and hardware vendors to protect against security vulnerabilities.
