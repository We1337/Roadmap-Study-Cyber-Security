It seems there might be a slight mistake in the command you provided. The correct syntax is `ps aux` (without the hyphen before `aux`). Here's what the command does:

1. **`ps`**: This is the command itself, which stands for "process status." It is used to display information about processes.
2. **`aux`**: These are command-line options that modify the behavior of the `ps` command:
   - **`a`**: This option selects all processes on a terminal, regardless of whether they are associated with the terminal session or not.
   - **`u`**: This option displays a detailed output that includes the user-oriented format. It provides information such as the user who started the process, the process ID (PID), the parent process ID (PPID), the CPU and memory usage, the start time, and the command that initiated the process.
   - **`x`**: This option selects all processes, regardless of whether they are associated with a terminal session or not. It's particularly useful for showing background processes that aren't tied to a specific terminal.

When you run the command `ps aux`, you will receive an output similar to the one I provided earlier for `ps -ef`. The main difference is that `ps aux` combines the behavior of both `ps -e` and `ps -f`, showing all processes and providing detailed information about them.

Here's a brief example of what the output might look like:

```
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.1 169484  6724 ?        Ss   Aug23   0:02 /sbin/init
root         2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    Aug23   0:00 [kthreadd]
...
john      1245  0.2  1.0 287932 43840 ?        S    Aug23   0:02 /usr/bin/python3 /home/john/app.py
...
```

Again, if you're looking for specific processes or information, you can use additional options or filters with the `ps` command to tailor the output to your needs.
