DirBuster is a Java-based GUI tool used for discovering hidden directories and files on a web server. It is developed by OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) and is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS operating systems.

DirBuster works by sending HTTP requests to the target web server and analyzing the responses for known directory and file names. It can be used with a dictionary file that contains a list of common directory and file names, or with a custom wordlist.

Some of the key features of DirBuster include:

1. Recursive scanning: DirBuster can scan directories and subdirectories recursively, allowing it to find hidden files and directories that may not be immediately visible.
2. Multi-threaded scanning: DirBuster uses multiple threads to scan a web server, allowing it to scan large web servers quickly.
3. Authentication support: DirBuster can be used to test authenticated web applications by allowing users to specify authentication credentials.
4. Logging: DirBuster can generate log files that provide detailed information about the discovered directories and files.

DirBuster also includes various advanced features such as file extension filtering, custom headers, and rate limiting.

While DirBuster can be a useful tool for web application security testing and identifying potential vulnerabilities, it is important to use it ethically and with permission. Using it on a web server without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences.
