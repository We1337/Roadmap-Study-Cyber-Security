Dirb (Directory Brute) is an open-source command-line tool used for discovering hidden directories and files on a web server. It is written in C and is available for Unix-based operating systems such as Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.

Dirb works by sending HTTP requests to the target web server and analyzing the responses for known directory and file names. It can be used with a dictionary file that contains a list of common directory and file names, or with a custom wordlist.

Some of the key features of Dirb include:

1. Recursive scanning: Dirb can scan directories and subdirectories recursively, allowing it to find hidden files and directories that may not be immediately visible.
2. Fast scanning: Dirb is designed to be fast and efficient, allowing it to scan large web servers quickly.
3. Logging: Dirb can generate log files that provide detailed information about the discovered directories and files.
4. Authentication support: Dirb can be used to test authenticated web applications by allowing users to specify authentication credentials.

While Dirb can be a useful tool for web application security testing and identifying potential vulnerabilities, it is important to use it ethically and with permission. Using it on a web server without permission is illegal and can have serious consequences.
