Programming tools are software applications that programmers use to create, debug, maintain, and optimize computer programs. These tools include integrated development environments (IDEs), code editors, compilers, debuggers, profilers, version control systems, and testing frameworks. Here are some examples of programming tools:

1. Visual Studio: Microsoft's integrated development environment for Windows that supports multiple programming languages, including C++, C#, and Visual Basic.
2. Eclipse: An open-source IDE that supports multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, and Python.
3. Sublime Text: A popular code editor that supports multiple programming languages and has a range of features, including syntax highlighting and code autocompletion. 
4. GCC: A compiler that supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, and Objective-C.
5. GDB: A debugger that supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, and Fortran. 
6. Valgrind: A tool for profiling and debugging code that can detect memory leaks, memory errors, and other performance issues. 
7. Git: A version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code and collaborate on projects with other developers. 
8. Selenium: A testing framework for web applications that allows developers to write automated tests for their code. 

These are just a few examples of the many programming tools available to developers. Each tool has its own set of features and capabilities, and developers often use a combination of tools to build, debug, and optimize their code.
