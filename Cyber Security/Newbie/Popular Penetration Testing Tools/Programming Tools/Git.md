Git is a free, open-source version control system that was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It is widely used by software developers to manage source code changes and collaborate on software development projects.

Git works by creating a "repository" of all the files and code for a particular project. This repository tracks all changes made to the code over time, allowing developers to see who made changes, when the changes were made, and what changes were made. This makes it easy to revert to earlier versions of the code, and to collaborate with other developers on the same project.

Some of the key features of Git include:

- Distributed development: Git allows developers to work on the same code base simultaneously, even if they are in different locations.  
- Branching and merging: Git allows developers to create branches of the code base, allowing them to work on new features or bug fixes without affecting the main code base. They can then merge their changes back into the main code base when they are ready.  
- Commit tracking: Git tracks all changes made to the code over time, allowing developers to easily revert to earlier versions of the code if necessary.  
- Collaboration: Git allows multiple developers to work on the same code base at the same time, making it easy to collaborate on software development projects.  
- Open-source: Git is free and open-source, making it accessible to developers and organizations of all sizes.  

Git is used by millions of developers worldwide, and is widely considered to be one of the most popular and powerful version control systems available. It is widely used in both open-source and commercial software development projects, and is supported by a large and active community of developers.
