`naive-hashcat` is a command-line tool used for password cracking, specifically for hash types that are supported by Hashcat but don't require the advanced features and optimizations provided by the full Hashcat tool.

This tool is designed to be simpler and easier to use than Hashcat, making it a good choice for beginners who are learning about password cracking.

To use `naive-hashcat`, you will need to have a hash file containing the password hashes that you want to crack. You will also need to have a wordlist containing potential passwords to use in the cracking process.

Once you have these files, you can run `naive-hashcat` with the following command:

```
naive-hashcat -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist>
```

Replace `<hash type>` with the type of hash you want to crack (for example, `-m 1000` for an MD5 hash). Replace `<hash file>` with the path to the file containing the password hashes, and `<wordlist>` with the path to the wordlist containing potential passwords.

`naive-hashcat` will then attempt to crack the password hashes using the words in the wordlist. Note that cracking password hashes without permission is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences. It is important to only use `naive-hashcat` for educational purposes and with the consent of the system owner.
