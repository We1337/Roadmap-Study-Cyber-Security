`airmon-ng` is a command-line tool used in the Aircrack-ng suite, which is commonly used for testing the security of WiFi networks.

`airmon-ng` allows the user to enable or disable monitor mode on wireless interfaces, which is required for capturing wireless network traffic. This tool can also be used to identify wireless networks in the area, as well as other wireless devices that are connected to them.

To use `airmon-ng`, you will need to have Aircrack-ng installed on your system. Once installed, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```
sudo airmon-ng
```

This will display a list of wireless interfaces that are available on your system. To enable monitor mode on a specific interface, you can use the following command:

```
sudo airmon-ng start <interface>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the name of the wireless interface that you want to put into monitor mode. Once monitor mode is enabled, you can use other tools in the Aircrack-ng suite to capture and analyze wireless network traffic.

It's important to note that `airmon-ng` should be used ethically and legally. Using these tools without authorization or for malicious purposes is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences.
