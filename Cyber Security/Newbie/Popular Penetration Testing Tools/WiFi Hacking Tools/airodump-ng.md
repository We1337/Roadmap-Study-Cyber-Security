`airodump-ng` is a command-line tool in the Aircrack-ng suite that is used for capturing and analyzing wireless network traffic. It can be used to identify wireless access points, as well as the devices that are connected to them.

The `airodump-ng` tool can capture a variety of information, including the Service Set Identifier (SSID), the media access control (MAC) address of the access point, the channel it is operating on, and the encryption type being used.

To use `airodump-ng`, you will need to have Aircrack-ng installed on your system. Once installed, open a terminal and enter the following command:

```
sudo airodump-ng <interface>
```

Replace `<interface>` with the name of the wireless interface that you want to use for capturing network traffic. This will display a list of wireless networks in the area, along with information such as the MAC address, channel, and encryption type.

You can use the `--channel` option to specify a particular channel to capture on. For example, if you want to capture traffic on channel 6, you can use the following command:

```
sudo airodump-ng --channel 6 <interface>
```

You can also use the `--write` option to save the captured traffic to a file for later analysis. For example, the following command will save the captured traffic to a file named `capture.pcap`:

```
sudo airodump-ng --write capture.pcap <interface>
```

It's important to note that `airodump-ng` should be used ethically and legally. Using these tools without authorization or for malicious purposes is illegal and can result in serious legal consequences.
