ListDLLs is a command-line utility included in the Windows Sysinternals suite developed by Mark Russinovich. The utility is used to list all the dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) that are loaded into a process on a Windows system.

ListDLLs can be useful in diagnosing issues related to DLL conflicts or dependencies. By running ListDLLs with the appropriate command-line options, users can see which DLLs are being loaded by a particular process, as well as any conflicts or errors that may be occurring.

Some of the most common command-line options for ListDLLs include:

-   -r: Recurse subdirectories when scanning for processes.
-   -u: Show only DLLs loaded by the specified user-mode process ID (PID).
-   -x: Show DLLs that have been unloaded.
-   -v: Show verbose information, including version and company name information for DLLs.

ListDLLs can be run from a Windows command prompt or from within a script or batch file. It is typically used by system administrators or developers who need to troubleshoot issues related to DLLs or process dependencies.
