Portmon, also known as Port Monitor, is a free system utility developed by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell as part of the Windows Sysinternals suite. It is designed to monitor and display serial and parallel port activity on a Windows system.

Portmon works by capturing and analyzing data sent and received over serial and parallel ports. It can display detailed information about the data, including data timing, parity, and other information that can be used to diagnose issues related to serial and parallel port communication.

Some of the features of Portmon include:

- Real-time port monitoring: Portmon captures port activity in real-time, allowing users to see port activity as it happens.
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities: Portmon includes powerful filtering and search capabilities, allowing users to filter and sort port activity based on a wide range of criteria, including port name, data type, and more.
- Detailed error reporting: Portmon captures detailed error messages and status codes, making it easier to diagnose issues related to port activity.
- Flexible logging options: Portmon allows users to log port activity to a file, making it easier to analyze port activity over time.

Portmon is commonly used by system administrators, IT professionals, and developers to diagnose issues related to serial and parallel port communication. It is available for download from the Microsoft website as part of the Windows Sysinternals suite.
