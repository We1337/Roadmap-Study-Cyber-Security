Procmon, short for Process Monitor, is a powerful Windows system utility developed by Mark Russinovich and Bryce Cogswell, and now part of the Windows Sysinternals suite. It is designed to monitor and display real-time activity on a Windows system, including file system and registry activity, network traffic, process and thread activity, and more.

Procmon works by monitoring system events in real-time and displaying them in a graphical interface that can be filtered, searched, and customized to meet specific needs. This allows users to quickly identify and troubleshoot issues related to system activity, such as detecting malware or identifying system performance bottlenecks.

Some of the features of Procmon include:

- Real-time system monitoring: Procmon captures system activity in real-time, allowing users to see system activity as it happens.
- Comprehensive event filtering: Procmon includes powerful filtering capabilities, allowing users to filter and sort events based on a wide range of criteria, including process name, file path, and more.
- Advanced search capabilities: Procmon includes powerful search capabilities, allowing users to search for specific events or data within captured events.
- Process and thread activity monitoring: Procmon displays detailed information about running processes and threads, including CPU usage, memory usage, and more.
- Detailed error reporting: Procmon captures detailed error messages and status codes, making it easier to troubleshoot issues related to system activity.

Procmon is commonly used by system administrators, IT professionals, and developers to monitor and troubleshoot system activity on Windows systems. It is available for download from the Microsoft website as part of the Windows Sysinternals suite.
