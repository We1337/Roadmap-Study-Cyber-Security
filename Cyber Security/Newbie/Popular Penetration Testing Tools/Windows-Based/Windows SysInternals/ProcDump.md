ProcDump is a command-line utility developed by Mark Russinovich and now part of the Windows Sysinternals suite. It is designed to capture and create memory dumps of Windows processes based on specified criteria such as CPU usage, memory usage, and exception conditions.

ProcDump works by monitoring the specified process for the specified criteria and creating a memory dump file when the criteria are met. Memory dumps contain information about the process and its memory usage, which can be analyzed to diagnose issues related to the process, such as crashes or performance issues.

Some of the features of ProcDump include:

- CPU and memory monitoring: ProcDump can monitor the specified process for CPU and memory usage, creating a memory dump file when usage exceeds the specified threshold.
- Exception monitoring: ProcDump can monitor the specified process for exceptions, such as access violations or unhandled exceptions, and create a memory dump file when an exception occurs.
- Customizable dump file settings: ProcDump allows users to customize the dump file settings, such as file name, file size, and dump type.
- Remote process dumping: ProcDump can create memory dump files of remote processes running on a networked Windows system.

ProcDump is commonly used by system administrators, IT professionals, and developers to diagnose issues related to Windows processes, such as crashes or performance issues. It is available for download from the Microsoft website as part of the Windows Sysinternals suite.
