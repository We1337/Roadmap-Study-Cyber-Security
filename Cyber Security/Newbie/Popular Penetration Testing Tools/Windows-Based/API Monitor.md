API Monitor is a powerful Windows system utility that allows users to monitor and display API calls made by Windows applications and services in real-time. It was developed by Rohitab Batra and is available as a free download on his website.

API Monitor works by intercepting and displaying API calls made by Windows applications and services, including calls to system libraries such as kernel32.dll and user32.dll. It displays detailed information about each API call, including parameters passed, return values, and timing information, which can be used to diagnose issues related to application behavior and performance.

Some of the features of API Monitor include:

- Real-time API monitoring: API Monitor captures API calls in real-time, allowing users to see application activity as it happens.
- Comprehensive API filtering: API Monitor includes powerful filtering capabilities, allowing users to filter and sort API calls based on a wide range of criteria, including process name, API name, and more.
- Advanced search capabilities: API Monitor includes powerful search capabilities, allowing users to search for specific API calls or data within captured API calls.
- Customizable output: API Monitor allows users to customize the output format of captured API calls, including exporting data to a file or to a database.

API Monitor is commonly used by system administrators, IT professionals, and developers to monitor and diagnose issues related to application behavior and performance on Windows systems. It is available as a free download from Rohitab Batra's website.
