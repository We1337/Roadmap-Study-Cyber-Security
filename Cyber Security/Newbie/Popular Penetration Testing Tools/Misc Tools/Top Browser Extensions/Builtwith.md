2. Content management system (CMS): This includes information on the CMS platform used by the website, such as WordPress, Drupal, or Joomla.
3. E-commerce platform: This includes information on the e-commerce platform used by the website, such as Shopify or Magento.
4. Web framework: This includes information on the web framework used by the website, such as Ruby on Rails or Laravel.

BuiltWith is a useful tool for developers, marketers, and business owners who want to gain insights into their competitors' website technology stacks, or who want to analyze the technology trends in a particular industry. It can also be used to identify potential security vulnerabilities in a website's technology stack, such as outdated software versions or unsecured hosting providers.
