Here are some additional miscellaneous tools that may be useful for software development:

1. Postman: a tool for testing and documenting APIs, allowing developers to easily send requests, test responses, and view API documentation.
2. Fiddler: a web debugging proxy tool that allows developers to intercept and inspect HTTP traffic between a web client and server, making it easier to troubleshoot issues.
3. Wireshark: a network protocol analyzer that allows developers to capture and analyze network traffic in real-time, making it easier to troubleshoot network issues.
4. Notepad++: a text editor that supports a wide range of programming languages, providing syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and other useful features for writing code.
5. Sublime Text: a lightweight text editor that is highly customizable and supports a wide range of programming languages, providing features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and more.
6. WinSCP: a free, open-source SFTP, SCP, and FTP client for Windows that allows developers to securely transfer files between local and remote systems.
7. VirtualBox: a free, open-source virtualization tool that allows developers to run multiple operating systems on the same machine, making it easier to test software in different environments.
8. Docker: a platform for building, deploying, and running applications in containers, allowing developers to package their applications and dependencies in a portable format that can be run anywhere.

These tools are just a few examples of the many useful tools available for software development. The choice of which tools to use will depend on the specific requirements of the project and the preferences of the development team.
