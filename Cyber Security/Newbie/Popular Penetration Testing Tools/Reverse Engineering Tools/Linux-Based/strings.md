`strings` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that is used to extract printable characters from a binary file. It works by searching through a file's contents and identifying sequences of characters that are likely to be strings.

When run on a file, the `strings` utility searches through the file's contents and extracts any sequences of printable characters that are at least four characters long. By default, `strings` will only extract ASCII characters, but it can be configured to extract other character sets as well.

The `strings` utility is often used to search for human-readable text in binary files, such as executable files or libraries. This can be useful for identifying text strings that are hard-coded into a program, such as error messages or other diagnostic information.

In addition to its basic functionality, `strings` also includes a number of options that can be used to control its behavior. For example, the `-n` option can be used to specify the minimum length of a string that `strings` should extract, and the `-e` option can be used to specify the character encoding that `strings` should use.

Overall, `strings` is a useful tool for working with binary files in Unix and Unix-like systems, and it is commonly used by system administrators, developers, and security professionals.
