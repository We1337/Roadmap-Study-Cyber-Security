`objdump` is a command-line utility in Unix and Unix-like operating systems that is used to display information about object files and executable files. It works by examining the contents of an object or executable file and displaying information such as the file header, section headers, symbol table, and disassembled machine code.

When run on an object or executable file, the `objdump` utility displays a variety of information about the file's contents, including:

- File header information, such as the file format, machine architecture, and entry point address.
- Section header information, such as the name, size, and type of each section.
- Symbol table information, such as the name, address, and type of each symbol defined in the file.
- Disassembled machine code, showing the assembly language instructions used by the program.

`objdump` also includes a number of options that can be used to control its behavior. For example, the `-t` option can be used to display the symbol table information, and the `-d` option can be used to display the disassembled machine code.

Overall, `objdump` is a powerful tool for examining object and executable files in Unix and Unix-like systems, and it is commonly used by system administrators, developers, and security professionals. It can be used to analyze programs, debug code, and identify potential security vulnerabilities.
