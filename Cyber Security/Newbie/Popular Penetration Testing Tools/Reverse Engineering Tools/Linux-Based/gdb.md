GDB, short for GNU Debugger, is a powerful debugging tool commonly used in the development of software. It is a command-line tool that allows developers to inspect and manipulate the state of a program at runtime. GDB supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, Ada, Fortran, and more.

Here are some basic commands that can be used in GDB:

1. `run`: Starts the execution of the program.
2. `break`: Sets a breakpoint at a specific line of code or function.
3. `next`: Executes the current line and moves to the next line of code.
4. `step`: Executes the current line and steps into any function calls on that line.
5. `print`: Displays the value of a variable.
6. `backtrace`: Displays a stack trace of the program, showing the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the program. 
7. `quit`: Exits GDB. 

These are just a few basic commands, and GDB has many more advanced features for debugging complex programs. To learn more about GDB, you can refer to the documentation or tutorials available online.
