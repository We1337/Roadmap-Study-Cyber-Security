dnsenum is an open-source network reconnaissance tool that is used to enumerate DNS information for a domain. It is a command-line tool that is written in Perl, and is available on most Unix-based systems.

dnsenum uses a variety of techniques to gather information about a domain, such as brute-force subdomain enumeration, zone transfers, and querying DNS servers for information. It can be used to gather information such as IP addresses, hostnames, MX records, DNS zone transfers, and other DNS-related information.

The tool supports a variety of output formats, including text, XML, and HTML, and can be customized with various options and parameters to tailor the scan to specific requirements.

dnsenum is a popular tool used by security professionals and penetration testers to gather information about a target domain and identify potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors. However, like any other network reconnaissance tool, it should be used responsibly and with permission from the owner of the domain being scanned.
