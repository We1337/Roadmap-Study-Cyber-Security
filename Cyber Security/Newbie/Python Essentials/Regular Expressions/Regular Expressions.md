Regular expressions (often referred to as regex or regexp) are a powerful tool for pattern matching and manipulation of strings. They provide a concise and flexible way to search, extract, and modify text based on specific patterns. Regular expressions are supported in many programming languages and text editors. Here's a brief overview of regular expressions:

Basic Syntax:
Regular expressions consist of a combination of literal characters and metacharacters that define the search pattern. Here are some commonly used metacharacters:

- `.` (dot): Matches any single character except a newline.
- `*`: Matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `+`: Matches one or more occurrences of the preceding element.
- `?`: Matches zero or one occurrence of the preceding element.
- `[ ]`: Matches any single character within the brackets.
- `^`: Matches the start of a line.
- `$`: Matches the end of a line.

Example:
Let's say we have the following text:

```
Hello, my email address is example@email.com.
```

To extract the email address from this text using a regular expression, you can use the pattern `[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.-]+`. Here's how it can be used in Python:

```python
import re

text = "Hello, my email address is example@email.com."
pattern = r"[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.-]+"

match = re.search(pattern, text)
if match:
    email = match.group()
    print(email)
```

This code will output the email address `example@email.com`.

Regular expressions provide numerous advanced features, such as capturing groups, quantifiers, anchors, and more. The syntax and behavior of regular expressions can vary slightly depending on the programming language or tool you are using. It's recommended to consult the documentation or specific resources for the language you are working with to learn more about regular expressions and their capabilities.
