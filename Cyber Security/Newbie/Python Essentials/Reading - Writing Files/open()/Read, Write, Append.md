Certainly! Here's an explanation of reading, writing, and appending to files using the `open()` function in Python:

1. Reading from a file:
To read the contents of a file, you can open it in reading mode (`"r"`) and use the `read()` method of the file object to retrieve the content. Here's an example:

```python
with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file as a string. You can also read the file line by line using a loop or the `readline()` method, which reads one line at a time.

2. Writing to a file:
To write content to a file, you can open it in writing mode (`"w"`) and use the `write()` method of the file object to add the desired content. Be careful as opening a file in writing mode will overwrite its existing content. Here's an example:

```python
with open("filename.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
```

In this example, the file "filename.txt" will be created (if it doesn't exist) or overwritten with the new content.

3. Appending to a file:
If you want to add content to an existing file without overwriting the existing data, you can open the file in append mode (`"a"`) and use the `write()` method to append the content. Here's an example:

```python
with open("filename.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("This is appended content.")
```

The `write()` method in append mode will add the content to the end of the file.

Remember to use the `with` statement when working with files. It ensures that the file is properly closed, even if an exception occurs. Closing the file is important to release system resources and ensure data integrity.

Additionally, when working with files, it's crucial to handle exceptions appropriately, such as `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError`, to account for possible errors that may occur during file operations.
