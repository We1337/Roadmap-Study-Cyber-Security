Diffie-Hellman (DH) Key Exchange is a cryptographic algorithm used to establish a shared secret key securely between two parties over an insecure communication channel. It enables secure key exchange without the need for pre-shared keys.

Here's an overview of how Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange works:

1.  Key Parameters:
    -   Prime Number (p): A large prime number shared between the two parties involved in the key exchange.
    -   Primitive Root (g): A number that is relatively prime to p and has a high multiplicative order modulo p. It generates the elements of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.
2.  Key Exchange Process: a. Agreement on Parameters: The two parties, commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, agree on the prime number (p) and primitive root (g) to be used in the key exchange. b. Private Key Generation: Both Alice and Bob independently generate their private keys. These private keys are random and kept secret.
    -   Alice generates a private key (a).
    -   Bob generates a private key (b).
3.  Public Key Calculation:
    -   Alice calculates her public key (A) by raising the primitive root (g) to the power of her private key (a), modulo p: A = g^a mod p.
    -   Bob calculates his public key (B) in a similar manner, using his private key (b): B = g^b mod p.
4.  Key Exchange:
    -   Alice sends her public key (A) to Bob over the insecure channel.
    -   Bob sends his public key (B) to Alice over the insecure channel.
5.  Shared Secret Key Calculation:
    -   Alice takes Bob's public key (B) and raises it to the power of her private key (a), modulo p: Secret Key = B^a mod p.
    -   Bob takes Alice's public key (A) and raises it to the power of his private key (b), modulo p: Secret Key = A^b mod p.
Both Alice and Bob now have the same shared secret key, which can be used for symmetric encryption, message authentication, or any other purpose requiring a shared secret.
6.  Security: The security of Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange relies on the computational difficulty of the discrete logarithm problem. Even if an eavesdropper intercepts the public keys exchanged during the key exchange, it is computationally infeasible to derive the private keys or the shared secret key without knowledge of the private keys.

It's important to note that Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange provides only key exchange, not authentication or encryption itself. Therefore, additional measures such as digital signatures or encryption algorithms should be used to ensure authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality in secure communication protocols.
