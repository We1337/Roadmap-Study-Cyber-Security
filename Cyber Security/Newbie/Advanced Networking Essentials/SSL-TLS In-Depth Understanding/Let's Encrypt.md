Sure! Let's Encrypt is a certificate authority that provides free SSL/TLS certificates. To obtain and renew Let's Encrypt certificates programmatically in Python, you can use the ACME protocol, which is the protocol Let's Encrypt uses for certificate issuance and management. The `acme` package in Python can help you interact with the Let's Encrypt ACME server. Here's an example of how you can use the `acme` package to obtain a certificate from Let's Encrypt:

```Python
from acme import client
from acme import messages
from acme import crypto_util

def get_lets_encrypt_certificate(domain):
    # Let's Encrypt ACME server URL
    ACME_SERVER = 'https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory'

    # Directory where account and certificate data will be stored
    STORAGE_DIR = '/path/to/storage/directory'

    # Create an ACME client
    directory = messages.Directory.from_json(client.Client.fetch_directory(ACME_SERVER))
    net = client.ClientV2(directory, net=client.ClientNetwork())
    account = client.Account.from_pem_file(STORAGE_DIR + '/account.pem')

    # Register or load an existing account
    if not account:
        registration = messages.NewRegistration.from_data(email='your-email@example.com')
        account = net.new_account(registration)

        # Save the account information
        with open(STORAGE_DIR + '/account.pem', 'w') as account_file:
            account_file.write(account.key.to_pem())

    # Request a new certificate
    identifiers = [messages.Identifier(typ=messages.IDENTIFIER_FQDN, value=domain)]
    authzr = net.new_authz(account, identifiers)

    # Perform domain validation (DNS-01 challenge)
    for authz in authzr:
        challenge = None
        for ch in authz.body.challenges:
            if isinstance(ch.chall, messages.DNS01):
                challenge = ch
                break

        # Perform necessary DNS configuration to complete the challenge
        # The challenge.token and challenge.validation will be used to create a DNS TXT record

        # Once the DNS is properly configured, notify the ACME server
        response, _ = net.answer_challenge(challenge, response=challenge.chall.response(account.key))

    # Request issuance of the certificate
    csr = crypto_util.make_csr(private_key_pem=account.key.to_pem(), domains=[domain])
    certr, _ = net.poll_and_request_issuance(csr=csr, authzr=authzr)

    # Save the certificate and private key
    with open(STORAGE_DIR + '/cert.pem', 'w') as cert_file:
        cert_file.write(certr.fullchain_pem)
    with open(STORAGE_DIR + '/privkey.pem', 'w') as key_file:
        key_file.write(account.key.to_pem())

    print('Certificate obtained successfully.')


# Example usage
get_lets_encrypt_certificate('example.com')
```

In this example, you'll need to replace `'your-email@example.com'` with your email address and `'example.com'` with the domain for which you want to obtain a certificate. You should also adjust the `STORAGE_DIR` variable to the directory path where you want to store the account and certificate data.

Please note that this example uses the ACME V2 protocol and assumes you have the necessary permissions and DNS control to complete the DNS-01 challenge for domain validation. Make sure to properly handle exceptions and errors in a real-world implementation and consider any specific requirements for your environment.
