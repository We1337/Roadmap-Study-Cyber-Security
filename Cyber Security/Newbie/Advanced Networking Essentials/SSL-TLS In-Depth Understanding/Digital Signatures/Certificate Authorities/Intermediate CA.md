An Intermediate CA (Certificate Authority) is a subordinate CA in a public key infrastructure (PKI) system that operates below the Root CA. Intermediate CAs are responsible for issuing and signing digital certificates on behalf of the Root CA or other higher-level CAs.

Here are key points about Intermediate CAs:

1.  Certificate Hierarchy: Intermediate CAs form a hierarchical structure beneath the Root CA. They receive their own digital certificate signed by the Root CA and use it to sign certificates for end entities or subordinate CAs further down the hierarchy. This hierarchical structure allows for delegation of certificate signing authority and better management of the PKI system.
2.  Chaining of Trust: The certificates issued by Intermediate CAs rely on the trust established by the Root CA. When an Intermediate CA signs a certificate, it includes its own digital signature along with the Root CA's digital signature. This creates a chain of trust, connecting the end-entity certificate back to the trusted Root CA.
3.  Enhanced Security and Flexibility: Intermediate CAs provide an additional layer of security and flexibility in the PKI system. By having Intermediate CAs below the Root CA, the compromise of an Intermediate CA's private key does not directly impact the trust in the Root CA or other Intermediate CAs.
4.  Certificate Issuance and Management: Intermediate CAs are responsible for verifying the identity of certificate applicants, ensuring they meet the necessary criteria for certificate issuance. They generate and sign certificates based on the policies and procedures defined by the Root CA. Intermediate CAs may also handle certificate revocation and manage certificate lifecycle processes.
5.  Trust Relationships: Intermediate CAs establish trust relationships with relying parties, such as web browsers or other systems, by distributing their own intermediate certificates. These intermediate certificates are usually included in the certificate chain sent during the SSL/TLS handshake, allowing the relying party to verify the certificate's authenticity and trustworthiness.
6.  Renewal and Revocation: Intermediate CAs' certificates have a limited validity period. When an Intermediate CA's certificate is close to expiration, it needs to be renewed or reissued by the Root CA. In case of compromise or other security concerns, the Root CA can revoke the Intermediate CA's certificate to invalidate all the certificates signed by that Intermediate CA.
7.  Cross-Certification: Intermediate CAs can also engage in cross-certification with other CAs or Intermediate CAs in different PKI domains. Cross-certification allows trust relationships to be established and maintained across different PKI hierarchies, enabling secure communication between separate domains.

Intermediate CAs add flexibility to the PKI system, allowing for better scalability, improved management, and more granular control over certificate issuance. They assist in maintaining the integrity and security of the PKI infrastructure while reducing the impact of a compromise at lower levels of the hierarchy.
