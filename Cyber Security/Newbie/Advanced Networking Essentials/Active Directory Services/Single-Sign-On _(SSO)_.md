Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications or systems using a single set of login credentials. With SSO, users authenticate themselves once, typically at the beginning of a session, and then gain access to multiple applications without the need to re-enter their credentials for each individual application.

Here are key points about Single Sign-On (SSO):

1.  Simplified User Experience: SSO simplifies the user experience by eliminating the need for users to remember and manage multiple sets of credentials for different applications. They only need to authenticate once, and subsequent access to other applications is seamless.
2.  Centralized Authentication: SSO employs a centralized authentication mechanism. When a user attempts to access an application, it redirects the user to an identity provider (IdP) or authentication service. The IdP authenticates the user and generates a security token or session ticket that is then used to grant access to the requested application.
3.  Security Tokens: SSO uses security tokens to represent the authenticated user's identity and permissions. These tokens can be in the form of JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) assertions, or other token formats. The tokens contain information about the user, the issuing IdP, and any additional attributes or claims.
4.  Single Point of Authentication: With SSO, there is a single point of authentication, typically the IdP. This centralizes user authentication, allowing organizations to enforce stronger security measures, such as multi-factor authentication, at the IdP level.
5.  Federated Identity: SSO can be achieved through federated identity protocols like Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), OpenID Connect, or OAuth. These protocols enable the exchange of authentication and authorization information between different systems and applications, allowing SSO across organizational boundaries.
6.  Session Management: SSO systems typically manage user sessions, tracking the user's authentication status and granting access to applications during the session. This eliminates the need for individual applications to handle authentication and session management, simplifying application development and maintenance.
7.  Benefits for Organizations: SSO provides several benefits for organizations, including improved user productivity, reduced password fatigue, centralized user management and access control, and enhanced security through centralized authentication and authorization policies.
8.  Integration with Existing Systems: SSO can be integrated with various systems and applications, including web-based applications, cloud services, enterprise applications, and mobile applications. It allows organizations to provide a seamless and consistent authentication experience across different platforms.

SSO is widely used in enterprise environments, educational institutions, and various online services to streamline access and enhance user convenience. It simplifies user authentication and access management, improves security, and enhances user productivity by reducing the need for multiple logins across different systems and applications.
