When using iptables, you can control the responses to network connections by configuring rules in the INPUT, FORWARD, and OUTPUT chains. Here are some common connection responses that can be achieved with iptables:

1.  ACCEPT: This response allows the connection and lets the packet pass through the firewall. It is typically used when you want to allow certain types of network connections.

Example rule: `iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT`

This rule accepts incoming TCP connections on port 22 (SSH) and allows them to reach the local system.

2.  DROP: With this response, the packet is silently dropped without any notification. No response is sent back to the source, making it appear as if the connection does not exist. It is commonly used for blocking unwanted or malicious traffic.

Example rule: `iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.10 -j DROP`

This rule drops all incoming packets from the IP address 192.168.0.10.

3.  REJECT: This response rejects the connection and sends an error response back to the source, indicating that the connection is not allowed. The rejection can be done at the network layer or the transport layer.

Example rule: `iptables -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type echo-request -j REJECT`

This rule rejects incoming ICMP echo requests (ping) and sends an ICMP "Destination Unreachable" response back to the source.

4.  REDIRECT: The REDIRECT target is used for redirecting network connections to a different destination, typically used for port forwarding or redirecting traffic to a proxy server.

Example rule: `iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8080`

This rule redirects incoming TCP connections on port 80 to port 8080 using Network Address Translation (NAT).

5.  LOG: By using the LOG target, you can log information about the packets that match a specific rule. This can be useful for monitoring network traffic and troubleshooting connectivity issues.

Example rule: `iptables -A INPUT -j LOG --log-prefix "INPUT DROP: "`

This rule logs all packets that are dropped by the INPUT chain with a log prefix "INPUT DROP:".

These are just a few examples of the different connection responses that can be achieved with iptables. By configuring rules in the appropriate chains and specifying the desired response, you can control how connections are handled by the firewall and tailor the network security and behavior to your requirements.
