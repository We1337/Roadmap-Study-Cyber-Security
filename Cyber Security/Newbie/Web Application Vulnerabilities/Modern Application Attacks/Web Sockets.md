WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication between a client (typically a web browser) and a server over a single, long-lived connection. Unlike traditional HTTP requests that follow a request-response model, WebSockets allow for real-time, bi-directional communication between the client and the server.

Here are some key points about WebSockets:

1.  Protocol Upgrade: The WebSocket protocol starts with an HTTP handshake, where the client sends an upgrade request to the server to switch from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol. If the server supports WebSocket communication, it responds with an upgrade response, and the WebSocket connection is established.
2.  Persistent Connection: Once the WebSocket connection is established, it remains open as long as both the client and server desire, enabling continuous communication without the need to establish a new connection for each request.
3.  Full-Duplex Communication: WebSockets allow simultaneous, bi-directional communication between the client and server. Both parties can send and receive messages independently at any time without waiting for a request or response.
4.  Real-Time Updates: WebSockets are ideal for real-time applications that require instant updates, such as chat applications, collaborative tools, stock tickers, and live sports scores. Instead of relying on periodic requests, the server can push updates to the client instantly.
5.  Efficient Communication: Unlike traditional HTTP polling, where the client repeatedly sends requests to the server, WebSockets use a lightweight protocol that minimizes the overhead of data transfer. This reduces latency and conserves server and network resources.
6.  Cross-Domain Communication: WebSockets follow the same-origin policy, meaning they are subject to cross-origin restrictions. However, WebSocket connections can be established across different domains by including appropriate CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers in the server's response.
7.  WebSocket Libraries and APIs: Various programming languages and frameworks provide WebSocket libraries and APIs that simplify WebSocket communication for both the client and server-side development. These libraries handle the low-level details of the WebSocket protocol, making it easier to work with WebSockets.

WebSockets offer an efficient and flexible means of real-time communication between clients and servers, enabling interactive and responsive web applications. However, it's important to ensure the security of WebSocket connections by implementing appropriate authentication, authorization, and data validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and protect against potential vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) and server-side vulnerabilities.
