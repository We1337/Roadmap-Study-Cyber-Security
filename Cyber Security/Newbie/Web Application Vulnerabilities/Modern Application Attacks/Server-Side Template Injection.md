Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a web application vulnerability that occurs when untrusted user input is directly embedded into a server-side template. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code within the template context, leading to various security risks.

Here's how Server-Side Template Injection works and its potential impact:

1.  Template Engines: Web applications often use template engines to separate the presentation logic from the application code. These template engines interpret templates containing dynamic content and generate the final HTML or other output.
2.  Untrusted User Input: SSTI vulnerabilities arise when the application incorporates user-supplied input into server-side templates without proper validation or sanitization. This can happen when user input is directly interpolated into the template or used to construct dynamic template paths.
3.  Code Execution: Attackers exploit SSTI vulnerabilities by injecting malicious code or template syntax into user-controlled input. This code is then executed within the template engine's context, allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands or access sensitive data.
4.  Impact: Successful SSTI attacks can have severe consequences, including:
    -   Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control over the application and underlying infrastructure.
    -   Information Disclosure: SSTI vulnerabilities can expose sensitive system files, configuration data, or database contents, leading to data leakage and further attacks.
    -   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF): Attackers can leverage SSTI to make the server-side template issue requests to internal resources, potentially accessing unauthorized information or performing actions on behalf of the server.
    -   Denial of Service: Malicious code injected through SSTI can cause resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service condition.

To mitigate Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities, consider the following preventive measures:

1.  Input Validation and Sanitization: Always validate and sanitize user input before incorporating it into server-side templates. Avoid directly embedding untrusted input into templates without proper scrutiny.
2.  Contextual Output Encoding: Encode or escape dynamic content to prevent the interpretation of template syntax within user input. Ensure that user-controlled input is treated as data and not as template code.
3.  Template Engine Configuration: Configure the template engine to enable strict sandboxing or disable dangerous features that can execute arbitrary code.
4.  Secure Development Practices: Follow secure coding practices, including code reviews and security testing, to identify and address potential SSTI vulnerabilities.
5.  Least Privilege: Run server-side processes with minimal privileges and restrict access to sensitive resources or functionality.
6.  Regular Updates and Patches: Keep template engines and associated libraries up to date with the latest security patches and updates.
7.  Security Testing: Conduct thorough security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address any SSTI vulnerabilities.

By implementing these measures, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities and protect their web applications from code execution and data disclosure attacks.
