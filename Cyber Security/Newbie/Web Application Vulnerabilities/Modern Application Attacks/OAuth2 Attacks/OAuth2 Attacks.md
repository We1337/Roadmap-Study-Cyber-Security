OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework used by many applications and APIs to grant limited access to user resources on other systems, without sharing the user's credentials. While OAuth 2.0 provides a secure mechanism for authorization, there are several common attacks that can exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of OAuth 2.0.

Here are some notable OAuth 2.0 attacks:

1.  Authorization Code Injection: Attackers intercept the authorization code exchanged between the client application and the authorization server. This can occur through techniques like Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, phishing, or insecure redirect URIs. The attacker can then use the stolen authorization code to obtain an access token, gaining unauthorized access to the user's resources.
2.  Access Token Leakage: If access tokens are not securely handled, attackers can gain access to them through techniques like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or insecure storage mechanisms. Once an attacker obtains an access token, they can use it to impersonate the user and access protected resources.
3.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a user into performing unintended actions on an OAuth 2.0 authorization server. By exploiting the user's authenticated session, the attacker can initiate unauthorized requests and obtain access tokens or refresh tokens.
4.  Redirect URI Manipulation: Attackers can modify the redirect URIs used during the OAuth 2.0 flow to redirect users to malicious sites after successful authorization. This can lead to phishing attacks, where users unknowingly grant access to their resources to an attacker-controlled application.
5.  Malicious Application: An attacker can create a malicious client application and trick users into authorizing access to their resources. This can be done by imitating a legitimate application or by exploiting user trust through social engineering techniques.

To mitigate OAuth 2.0 attacks, consider the following preventive measures:

1.  Secure Implementation: Implement OAuth 2.0 following best practices and security guidelines provided by the OAuth 2.0 framework and the specific authorization server or library being used.
2.  Secure Communication: Ensure that all communication between the client application, authorization server, and resource server is encrypted using secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS).
3.  Validate Redirect URIs: Validate and whitelist the redirect URIs to prevent open redirects and ensure that the user is redirected only to trusted and approved locations.
4.  User Awareness and Education: Educate users about OAuth 2.0 and the risks associated with granting access to their resources. Encourage them to review and verify the permissions requested by the client application.
5.  Strong Token Security: Implement secure storage and handling of access tokens and refresh tokens to prevent leakage or unauthorized access.
6.  Anti-CSRF Measures: Implement CSRF protection mechanisms, such as including anti-CSRF tokens in OAuth 2.0 requests or using the state parameter to validate the integrity of the authorization process.
7.  OAuth 2.0 Security Audits: Conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments of the OAuth 2.0 implementation to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities.

It's important to note that the specific measures to mitigate OAuth 2.0 attacks may vary depending on the implementation details and the specific vulnerabilities identified. It's recommended to follow the security recommendations provided by the OAuth 2.0 framework and consult relevant documentation or security experts for guidance.
