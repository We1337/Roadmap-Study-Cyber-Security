HTTP response splitting is a web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker manipulates the HTTP response headers in a way that allows them to insert arbitrary content into the response. This vulnerability can lead to various attacks, such as cache poisoning, session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), and phishing.

Here's how HTTP response splitting works and its potential impact:

1.  HTTP Response Headers: HTTP responses consist of headers and a body. The headers contain information about the response, including content type, length, caching directives, and cookies.
2.  Response Splitting: In HTTP response splitting attacks, an attacker manipulates user-supplied input or crafted requests to inject additional headers or control characters into the response headers. By inserting line breaks or other special characters, the attacker can create multiple responses that appear as separate responses to the client but are interpreted as a single response by the server.
3.  Impact: The impact of successful HTTP response splitting attacks can vary depending on the specific scenario and vulnerability. However, common risks include:
    -   Cache Poisoning: By splitting responses, an attacker can inject malicious content into the cache of intermediate servers or proxies. Subsequent users requesting the same resource may receive the poisoned response, leading to XSS attacks or unauthorized access.
    -   Session Hijacking: By injecting headers, an attacker can manipulate the session-related headers and cookies of other users, potentially hijacking their sessions and gaining unauthorized access to their accounts.
    -   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): HTTP response splitting can be used as part of an XSS attack to inject malicious scripts into a victim's browser. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    -   Phishing: Attackers may use HTTP response splitting to deceive users by injecting content that appears to be from a trusted source. This can be used for phishing attacks, tricking users into divulging sensitive information or performing unintended actions.

To prevent HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities, consider the following mitigation techniques:

1.  Input Validation and Sanitization: Implement proper input validation and sanitization to ensure that user-supplied input does not contain control characters or characters that can manipulate headers.
2.  Output Encoding: Encode any user-generated or dynamic content that is included in the response headers to prevent malicious injection.
3.  HTTP Header Validation: Validate and sanitize user input used in generating response headers. Ensure that user input cannot be interpreted as header delimiters or control characters.
4.  Secure Coding Practices: Follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities. Validate and sanitize all input before using it in HTTP responses.
5.  Security Testing: Conduct thorough security testing, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and address any HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities.

By implementing these measures, organizations can mitigate the risks associated with HTTP response splitting and ensure the integrity and security of their web applications and the data they process.
