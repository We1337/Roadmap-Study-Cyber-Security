Modern application attacks are a constantly evolving set of techniques and methods that threat actors use to exploit vulnerabilities in modern applications. These attacks can result in data breaches, financial losses, and reputational damage for organizations.

Here are some common types of modern application attacks:

1.  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS is a type of injection attack that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal user data, session tokens, and sensitive information.
2.  SQL Injection (SQLi): SQLi is an attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the SQL database layer of an application. Attackers use SQLi to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
3.  Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF is an attack that forces an authenticated user to perform an unwanted action on a web application. Attackers can use CSRF to manipulate the user's session and perform unauthorized actions.
4.  Remote Code Execution (RCE): RCE is an attack that allows attackers to execute malicious code on a target system. Attackers use RCE to take control of systems and steal sensitive data.
5.  File Inclusion Vulnerabilities: File inclusion vulnerabilities are a type of injection attack that allows attackers to include files from remote servers. Attackers can use file inclusion vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code, steal sensitive data, and compromise systems.
6.  Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): DDoS attacks flood a target system with traffic to overload its resources and make it unavailable to users. Attackers use DDoS attacks to disrupt services, extort money, or carry out other malicious activities.
7.  Malware and Ransomware: Malware and ransomware attacks use malicious software to compromise systems, steal data, and extort money. Attackers can use malware and ransomware to spread across networks and compromise large numbers of systems.

To protect against modern application attacks, organizations can implement a range of security measures, including:

1.  Secure coding practices: Implement secure coding practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into applications.
2.  Vulnerability management: Use vulnerability management tools to detect and remediate vulnerabilities in applications and systems.
3.  Web application firewalls: Use web application firewalls to detect and block attacks against web applications.
4.  Intrusion detection and prevention systems: Use intrusion detection and prevention systems to monitor network traffic and detect and block attacks.
5.  Endpoint protection: Use endpoint protection software to detect and prevent malware and ransomware attacks.
6.  Security testing: Regularly conduct security testing, including penetration testing and vulnerability scanning, to identify weaknesses in applications and systems.
7.  User awareness training: Provide user awareness training to educate users about the risks of modern application attacks and how to avoid them.

By implementing these security measures and staying up-to-date on the latest threats and attack techniques, organizations can reduce the risk of modern application attacks and protect their systems and data from compromise.
