Broken authentication refers to a security vulnerability that occurs when the authentication and session management mechanisms of a web application are implemented incorrectly or inadequately. This can lead to various attacks, such as unauthorized access, identity theft, session hijacking, or privilege escalation.

Here are some common causes and examples of broken authentication vulnerabilities:

1.  Weak or predictable credentials: When the application allows users to choose weak passwords or uses default or easily guessable credentials, it becomes vulnerable to brute-force attacks or credential guessing.
2.  Insecure storage of credentials: If the application stores passwords or authentication tokens in plain text or uses weak hashing algorithms without salting, it becomes susceptible to password retrieval or cracking attacks.
3.  Improper session management: When session identifiers or authentication tokens are not properly managed, such as using predictable session IDs, failing to invalidate sessions on logout, or insufficiently randomizing tokens, attackers can hijack user sessions or replay intercepted session tokens.
4.  Insufficient login controls: If the application lacks protection against account lockouts, rate limiting, or fails to implement CAPTCHA for preventing automated attacks, it becomes easier for attackers to perform brute-force or credential stuffing attacks.
5.  Session fixation: This occurs when an attacker forces a user's session identifier to a known value, allowing the attacker to hijack the user's session after authentication.

Mitigating broken authentication vulnerabilities involves implementing proper security controls and following best practices:

1.  Strong authentication: Enforce strong password policies, encourage the use of multi-factor authentication (MFA), and implement mechanisms to detect and prevent the use of weak or compromised credentials.
2.  Secure credential storage: Hash passwords with a strong hashing algorithm and apply a unique salt for each user. Consider using key derivation functions designed for password hashing, such as bcrypt or Argon2.
3.  Robust session management: Use secure session management techniques, such as generating random and unpredictable session identifiers, employing session timeouts, and securely managing session state on the server side.
4.  Secure login controls: Implement account lockouts, rate limiting, and CAPTCHA mechanisms to prevent automated attacks and discourage brute-force or credential stuffing attempts.
5.  Regular security assessments: Conduct periodic security assessments, including vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and code reviews, to identify and remediate authentication-related vulnerabilities.
6.  User education: Educate users about the importance of strong passwords, the risks of sharing credentials, and best practices for protecting their accounts.

By implementing these security measures and following secure coding practices, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of broken authentication vulnerabilities and enhance the security of their web applications and user accounts.
