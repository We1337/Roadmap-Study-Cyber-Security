LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) injection is a type of security vulnerability that occurs when untrusted user input is improperly handled and used in LDAP queries. It allows an attacker to manipulate LDAP queries to perform unauthorized actions, gain unauthorized access, or extract sensitive information from an LDAP directory.

Here's how LDAP injection typically works:

1.  Improper input handling: LDAP injection vulnerabilities arise when user input is not properly validated, sanitized, or escaped before being included in LDAP queries. This can happen when user input is directly concatenated into LDAP filter strings or search parameters.
2.  Injection payloads: Attackers inject specially crafted input that manipulates the LDAP query's syntax or logic. The injected input may include special characters or escape sequences that modify the query's behavior or enable additional LDAP operations.
3.  Query manipulation: When the application constructs LDAP queries using user input without proper validation, the injected LDAP code is executed. This can result in unauthorized access to LDAP directories, data retrieval, modification, or other unauthorized operations.
4.  Impact of LDAP injection: The impact of LDAP injection vulnerabilities can vary depending on the privileges of the LDAP user account being used, the directory's configuration, and the attacker's goals. Successful LDAP injection attacks can lead to unauthorized access, disclosure of sensitive information, modification of data, or even the compromise of the entire LDAP directory.

To mitigate LDAP injection attacks, developers should consider the following security measures:

1.  Input validation and sanitization: Implement strict input validation and sanitization techniques to ensure that user input is properly validated, filtered, or escaped before being used in LDAP queries. Use parameterized queries or built-in LDAP query libraries that separate user input from the query logic.
2.  Parameterized queries: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the LDAP library or framework. These techniques help ensure that user input is treated as data and prevent the injection of malicious LDAP code.
3.  Input filtering and escaping: Apply proper input filtering and escaping techniques specific to LDAP queries. Escape special characters and sanitize user input to prevent unintended interpretation of input as LDAP code.
4.  Principle of least privilege: Limit the privileges of the LDAP user account used by the application to perform LDAP operations. Assign the minimum required permissions to reduce the potential impact of a successful LDAP injection attack.
5.  Regular security testing: Conduct regular security testing, including vulnerability scans and manual penetration testing, to identify and remediate LDAP injection vulnerabilities. Keep the LDAP server software and associated libraries up to date with the latest security patches.

By implementing these security measures and following secure coding practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of LDAP injection attacks and enhance the security of their LDAP-enabled applications and directories.
