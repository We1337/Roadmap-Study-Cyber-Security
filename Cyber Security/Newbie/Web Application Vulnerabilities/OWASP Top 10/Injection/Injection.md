Injection refers to a web application security vulnerability where an attacker can insert malicious code or commands into an application's data input. This code is then executed by the application, which can lead to various types of attacks and unauthorized access to data or system resources.

There are several common types of injection attacks, including:

1. SQL Injection (SQLi): This occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL code into a data input field, which is then executed by the application's database. SQL injection can allow attackers to manipulate database queries, bypass authentication, retrieve sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even take control of the underlying server.
2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Although XSS is listed separately in the OWASP Top 10, it is also a form of injection attack. It involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts are executed by the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
3. Command Injection: This vulnerability occurs when an attacker can inject malicious commands into an application's command execution system. Command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server, potentially leading to remote code execution, unauthorized access, or system compromise.
4. XML Injection: This occurs when an attacker injects malicious content into XML-based data inputs, leading to parsing vulnerabilities. XML injection can result in disclosure of sensitive data, server-side request forgery (SSRF), denial of service, or remote code execution.
5. LDAP Injection: LDAP injection targets applications that use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for authentication or querying directory services. By injecting malicious LDAP statements, attackers can manipulate queries, bypass authentication, or gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.

Preventing injection attacks involves following secure coding practices, such as:

-   Input validation: Validate and sanitize all user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious content.
-   Parameterized queries or prepared statements: Use these techniques to separate data from code when constructing database queries, preventing SQL injection.
-   Escaping and encoding: Apply proper escaping and encoding techniques when dealing with user input and output to mitigate XSS and other injection attacks.
-   Least privilege principle: Ensure that application components, database accounts, and server environments have the minimum privileges necessary to operate effectively, limiting the potential impact of an injection attack.
-   Regular updates and patching: Keep all software components, frameworks, and libraries up to date to address known vulnerabilities that could be exploited through injection attacks.

By adopting these practices, developers can significantly reduce the risk of injection vulnerabilities in their web applications.
