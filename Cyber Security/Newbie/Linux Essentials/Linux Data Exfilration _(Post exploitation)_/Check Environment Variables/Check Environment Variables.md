To check the environment variables in Linux, you can use the `env` command or the `printenv` command. Both commands display the current environment variables and their corresponding values. Here's how you can use them:

1. Open a terminal or shell session.

2. Type either `env` or `printenv` and press Enter.

   ```shell
   env
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   printenv
   ```

3. The command will display a list of environment variables and their values. Each line represents an environment variable in the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`.

   ```shell
   VARIABLE1=value1
   VARIABLE2=value2
   VARIABLE3=value3
   ...
   ```

   The actual output will vary depending on your system and the environment variables set on your machine.

You can also check the value of a specific environment variable by using the `echo` command followed by the variable name prefixed with a `$` sign. For example:

```shell
echo $PATH
```

This will display the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

Note that environment variables are specific to the current shell session or process. Any changes made to the environment variables using the `export` command or within a script will affect only that particular session or process.
