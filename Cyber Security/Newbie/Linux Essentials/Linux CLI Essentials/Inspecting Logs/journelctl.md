Apologies for the typo in my previous response. The correct command is `journalctl`. `journalctl` is a powerful command-line utility for querying and viewing logs from the systemd journal, which is a centralized logging system used by many Linux distributions. The systemd journal captures and stores log messages from various system components, services, and applications. Here are some commonly used options and examples of using `journalctl`:

1. Viewing Logs:
   - `journalctl`: Display the full systemd journal, starting with the most recent entries.
   - `journalctl -n <number>`: Display the last `<number>` of log entries.
   - `journalctl -p <priority>`: Filter logs by priority level (0 to 7, where 0 is the highest).
   - `journalctl -u <unit>`: Show logs for a specific systemd unit (e.g., `journalctl -u sshd`).
   - `journalctl -f`: Follow the journal in real-time, continuously displaying new log entries.

2. Filtering Logs:
   - `journalctl _<field>=<value>`: Filter logs based on specific field-value pairs. For example, `journalctl _SYSTEMD_UNIT=sshd.service` shows logs for the `sshd.service` unit.
   - `journalctl --since <time>`: Display logs since a specific time (e.g., `journalctl --since "2023-05-20 10:00"`).
   - `journalctl --until <time>`: Show logs until a specific time.
   - `journalctl -b`: Display logs from the current boot.
   - `journalctl --disk-usage`: Show disk usage information for the journal.

3. Advanced Querying:
   - `journalctl _EXE=<executable_path>`: Filter logs based on the executed binary.
   - `journalctl --grep=<pattern>`: Search for a specific pattern or keyword within log messages.
   - `journalctl --field=<field>`: Display specific fields in log entries (e.g., `journalctl --field=_PID --field=MESSAGE`).
   - `journalctl --output=<format>`: Specify the output format, such as `short`, `json`, `json-pretty`, `cat`, `export`, etc.

4. Exporting Logs:
   - `journalctl --output=<format> > <output_file>`: Export logs to a file in the specified format. For example, `journalctl --output=json > logs.json`.

`journalctl` provides extensive filtering and querying capabilities to help you narrow down and analyze log entries based on various criteria. You can combine multiple options to refine your log viewing experience. The available options may vary depending on your Linux distribution and the version of systemd being used.

For more detailed information and additional usage options, you can refer to the `journalctl` manual page by running `man journalctl` in the terminal.
