   - `groupadd`: Create a new group.
   - `groupmod`: Modify group properties.
   - `groupdel`: Delete a group.

2. Process Management:
   - `ps`: List running processes.
   - `top`: Monitor real-time system resources and process activity.
   - `kill`: Terminate or send signals to processes.
   - `nice`: Set the priority of a process.
   - `renice`: Change the priority of running processes.

3. Service Management:
   - `systemctl`: Control system services using systemd.
   - `service`: Manage services using traditional SysVinit.
   - `chkconfig`: Configure system services to start on boot.
   - `systemd-analyze`: Analyze and optimize system boot time.
   - `journalctl`: View and manage system logs.

4. Package Management:
   - `apt` or `apt-get`: Package management for Debian-based distributions.
   - `dnf` or `yum`: Package management for Red Hat-based distributions.
   - `zypper`: Package management for openSUSE.
   - `pacman`: Package management for Arch Linux.
   - `snap`: Package management for snap packages.
   - `flatpak`: Package management for Flatpak applications.

5. File System Management:
   - `mount`: Mount a file system.
   - `umount`: Unmount a file system.
   - `df`: Show disk space usage.
   - `du`: Estimate file and directory space usage.
   - `fdisk` or `parted`: Partitioning tools.
   - `mkfs`: Create a file system on a partition.
   - `fsck`: Check and repair file system errors.

6. Network Configuration:
   - `ifconfig` or `ip`: Configure network interfaces.

   - `netstat`: Display network statistics and active connections.
   - `route`: View and modify routing tables.
   - `iptables` or `firewalld`: Configure firewall rules.
   - `ss`: Display socket statistics.

7. System Monitoring and Performance:
   - `top`: Monitor real-time system resources and process activity.
   - `htop`: Interactive process viewer and system monitor.
   - `vmstat`: Report virtual memory statistics.
   - `sar`: Collect, report, and analyze system activity.
   - `iostat`: Report I/O statistics of devices and partitions.
   - `nmon`: Monitor various system resources interactively.

8. System Backup and Restore:
   - `tar`: Archive and compress files and directories.
   - `rsync`: Efficiently synchronize and transfer files.
   - `dd`: Create disk images or clone disks.
   - `cpio`: Archive files and directories in a specified format.

These commands and tools provide the foundation for system management in Linux. However, it's important to note that specific commands and tools may vary depending on the Linux distribution and version you are using. Additionally, graphical user interfaces (GUI) and web-based administration tools are also available in many Linux distributions, providing alternative methods for managing and configuring the system.
