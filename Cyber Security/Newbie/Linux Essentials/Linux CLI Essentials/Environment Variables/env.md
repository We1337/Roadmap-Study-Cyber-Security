The `env` command is used to display the current environment variables in Linux. When executed without any arguments, it lists all the environment variables and their corresponding values. Here's how you can use the `env` command:

1. Open a terminal or shell session.

2. Type `env` and press Enter.

   ```shell
   env
   ```

3. The command will display a list of environment variables and their values. Each line represents an environment variable in the format `VARIABLE_NAME=value`.

   ```shell
   VARIABLE1=value1
   VARIABLE2=value2
   VARIABLE3=value3
   ...
   ```

   The actual output will vary depending on your system and the environment variables set on your machine.

The `env` command is helpful for inspecting the current environment variables, which can be useful for debugging, understanding the system configuration, or verifying that specific variables are correctly set.

If you want to display the value of a specific environment variable, you can use the `echo` command followed by the variable name prefixed with a `$` sign. For example:

```shell
echo $PATH
```

This will display the value of the `PATH` environment variable.

Note that environment variables are specific to the current shell session or process. Any changes made to the environment variables using the `export` command or within a script will affect only that particular session or process.
