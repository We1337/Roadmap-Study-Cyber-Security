Environment variables in Linux are variables that store information used by the operating system and applications to customize behavior, define paths, and provide configuration details. They are part of the shell environment and can be accessed by processes running on the system. Here are some key points about environment variables in Linux:

1. Variable Names: Environment variable names are typically in uppercase letters, although lowercase letters are also commonly used. They can include letters, numbers, and underscores. By convention, some environment variables have specific meanings and are widely recognized across different applications.

2. Setting Environment Variables:
   - Temporary setting: You can set an environment variable temporarily in the current shell session using the `export` command. For example: `export VARIABLE_NAME=value`.
   - Permanent setting: To set an environment variable permanently, you can add the `export` command to the shell initialization file such as `~/.bashrc` (for Bash) or `~/.profile`.

3. Displaying Environment Variables:
   - `env` or `printenv`: These commands display all environment variables and their values.
   - `echo $VARIABLE_NAME`: Displays the value of a specific environment variable.

4. Common Environment Variables:
   - `PATH`: Specifies the directories to search for executable programs.
   - `HOME`: Points to the home directory of the current user.
   - `USER`: Stores the username of the current user.
   - `LANG` or `LC_*`: Defines the system's default language and locale settings.
   - `PWD`: Represents the current working directory.

5. Using Environment Variables:
   - Environment variables can be accessed and used within shell scripts and commands by referencing their names prefixed with a `$` sign. For example, `echo $PATH` will display the value of the `PATH` variable.

6. Modifying Environment Variables:
   - You can modify the value of an environment variable within a shell session by assigning a new value to it. For example: `VARIABLE_NAME=new_value`.

7. Environment Variables in Scripts:
   - Shell scripts can declare and use their own environment variables within the script using the `export` command.
   - Environment variables set within a script are local to that script and its child processes by default.

8. Environment Variables in Configuration Files:
   - Some applications use configuration files where you can set specific environment variables to customize their behavior. The exact method of setting these variables varies depending on the application.

It's important to note that environment variables are process-specific, meaning they are inherited by child processes from their parent process. Changes made to environment variables in one shell session do not affect other sessions or future logins unless they are made in the appropriate initialization files.

Different Linux distributions and shells may have slight variations in the way environment variables are managed and initialized. It's recommended to refer to the documentation and specific guidelines for your Linux distribution and shell to understand the conventions and practices regarding environment variables.
