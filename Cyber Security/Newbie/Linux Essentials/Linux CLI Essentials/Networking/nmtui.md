`nmtui` is a command-line user interface for NetworkManager, which is a service that provides network connectivity and configuration on Linux systems. It allows you to interactively manage network connections, wireless networks, IP addressing, DNS settings, and more, using a text-based interface. Here are some common uses of `nmtui`:

1. Launching `nmtui`:
   - Run `nmtui` command in the terminal to launch the `nmtui` interface.

2. Network Connection Management:
   - Navigate using arrow keys and Tab key to move between options and buttons.
   - Edit or modify existing connections.
   - Create new network connections (wired, wireless, VLAN, etc.).
   - Enable or disable network connections.
   - Delete network connections.

3. Wireless Network Management:
   - Scan for available wireless networks.
   - Connect to a specific wireless network.
   - Provide authentication details (password) for secured wireless networks.

4. IP Addressing and DNS Configuration:
   - Configure IP addressing settings for network connections (IPv4 and IPv6).
   - Set the addressing method (automatic, manual, DHCP).
   - Specify IP addresses, subnet masks, gateways, and DNS servers.

5. Network Device Status:
   - View the status of network devices (connected, disconnected).
   - Activate or deactivate network devices.

6. Applying and Saving Changes:
   - After making changes, select the "Back" button to return to the main menu.
   - Select "Quit" to exit `nmtui` and apply the changes made.

`nmtui` provides an easy-to-use, menu-driven interface for managing network connections, making it particularly useful for systems without a graphical user interface or remote server management. It simplifies the process of configuring and managing network settings without the need for manually editing configuration files.

It's important to note that `nmtui` requires administrative privileges, so it should be run with `sudo` or as the root user to make changes to network settings.

Please note that the specific options and features available in `nmtui` may vary slightly depending on your Linux distribution and version. For more details and specific usage instructions, you can refer to the `nmtui` manual page by running `man nmtui` in the terminal.
