Wireshark is a popular open-source network protocol analyzer tool that is used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and security auditing. It is capable of capturing and analyzing network traffic in real-time, and provides a detailed view of network packets, their contents, and the protocols being used.

Wireshark is able to decode and dissect a wide range of protocols, including TCP, UDP, HTTP, DNS, and many others. It allows users to filter and search for specific packets, analyze network behavior, and detect potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

The tool supports a wide range of platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, and can be used with both wired and wireless networks. Wireshark provides a user-friendly graphical interface, as well as a command-line interface for more advanced users.

Wireshark is often used by network administrators, security professionals, and developers for network troubleshooting and debugging, protocol analysis, and vulnerability assessment. It is also used by attackers to capture and analyze network traffic in order to identify potential targets and exploits.

As with other network analysis tools, it is important to use Wireshark responsibly and ethically, and with permission from the owners of the network being monitored.
