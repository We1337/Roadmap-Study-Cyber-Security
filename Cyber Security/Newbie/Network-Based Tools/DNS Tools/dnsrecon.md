dnsrecon is an open-source tool used for network reconnaissance that is specifically designed for DNS enumeration. It is written in Python and is available on most Unix-based systems.

dnsrecon uses a variety of techniques to gather information about a domain, including zone transfers, reverse lookups, brute-force subdomain enumeration, and various other DNS queries. It can be used to gather information such as IP addresses, hostnames, MX records, DNS zone transfers, and other DNS-related information.

The tool supports a variety of output formats, including text, XML, and HTML, and can be customized with various options and parameters to tailor the scan to specific requirements. It also has features to detect DNS-based vulnerabilities such as cache poisoning and misconfigured DNS servers.

dnsrecon is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers to gather information about a target domain and identify potential vulnerabilities or attack vectors. However, like any other network reconnaissance tool, it should be used ethically and with permission from the owner of the domain being scanned.
