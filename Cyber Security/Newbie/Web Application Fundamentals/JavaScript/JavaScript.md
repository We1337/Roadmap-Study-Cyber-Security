JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used in web development to create dynamic and interactive web applications. JavaScript is a client-side language, meaning that it runs in the user's web browser rather than on the web server.

JavaScript can be used to create a wide range of web applications, from simple form validation scripts to complex single-page applications. Some of the key features of JavaScript include:

- Event-driven programming: JavaScript is designed to respond to user interactions, such as clicks and key presses, by triggering events and executing code in response.  
- Manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM): JavaScript can be used to manipulate the structure and content of web pages, allowing developers to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.  
- Asynchronous programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, which means that it can perform tasks in the background without blocking the main thread of execution.  
- Extensibility: JavaScript is an open and flexible language that can be extended with third-party libraries and frameworks, making it easy to build complex web applications.  

Some of the popular frameworks and libraries used in JavaScript development include React, Angular, Vue.js, and Node.js.

JavaScript is a widely used and versatile programming language that is essential to modern web development.
