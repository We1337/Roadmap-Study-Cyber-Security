JavaScript frameworks are collections of pre-written JavaScript code that provide a structured approach to building web applications. They typically include tools for managing application state, routing, data binding, and more. Frameworks can help simplify and streamline the development process by providing a consistent structure and set of conventions.

Here are some examples of popular JavaScript frameworks:

1. React: Developed by Facebook, React is a component-based library for building user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI in response to changes in data, and it can be used with other libraries and frameworks.
2. Angular: Developed by Google, Angular is a full-featured framework for building web applications. It includes tools for managing application state, routing, and data binding, as well as a rich set of UI components.
3. Vue.js: A progressive framework for building user interfaces, Vue.js emphasizes simplicity and ease of use. It includes tools for managing application state, routing, and data binding, and it can be used with other libraries and frameworks.
4. Ember.js: A full-featured framework for building web applications, Ember.js includes tools for managing application state, routing, and data binding, as well as a powerful set of conventions and best practices.
5. Backbone.js: A lightweight framework that provides a minimal set of tools for building web applications. Backbone.js emphasizes simplicity and flexibility, and it can be used with other libraries and frameworks.

Frameworks can help developers build web applications faster and more efficiently by providing a consistent structure and set of conventions. However, they can also add complexity and overhead to the development process, and they may not be suitable for all projects. It's important to evaluate the specific needs of a project and choose a framework that best fits those needs.
