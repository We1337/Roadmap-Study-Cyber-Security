Angular 2 is a major revision of the Angular framework, released in 2016 by Google. It represents a significant departure from the original AngularJS framework, with a focus on performance, modularity, and simplicity.

Some of the key features of Angular 2 include:

1. Component-based architecture: Angular 2 is built around a component-based architecture, similar to other modern frameworks like React and Vue.js. Components are the building blocks of an Angular 2 application, and they encapsulate both the presentation and behavior of a user interface.
2. Improved performance: Angular 2 is designed to be faster and more efficient than its predecessor. It achieves this through a number of optimizations, such as a new change detection algorithm, ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, and improved rendering performance.
3. Modular design: Angular 2 is designed to be modular, with a number of core modules that can be used to build applications of varying complexity. This makes it easier to manage dependencies and keep application code organized. 
4. Improved data binding: Angular 2 introduces a new syntax for data binding that simplifies the process of binding data to the UI. It also supports two-way data binding, allowing changes to the UI to be reflected back to the data model. 
5. Support for mobile: Angular 2 is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices, with features like touch support and responsive design.

Overall, Angular 2 represents a major evolution of the Angular framework, with significant improvements in performance, modularity, and ease of use. While it may require some additional learning for developers familiar with AngularJS, it offers a powerful and flexible platform for building modern web applications.
