JavaScript syntax is the set of rules that dictate how JavaScript code should be written. Here are some of the key syntax fundamentals of JavaScript:

- Statements: JavaScript code is composed of statements, which are instructions that tell the browser what to do. Statements can be terminated with a semicolon (;), although this is optional in some cases.  
- Variables: Variables are used to store values in JavaScript. Variables can be declared using the var, let, or const keywords, depending on whether they need to be mutable or immutable.  
- Data types: JavaScript supports several data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, null, undefined, objects, and arrays.
- Operators: JavaScript has a wide range of operators that can be used to perform arithmetic, comparison, and logical operations on values.  
- Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. Functions can be declared using the function keyword, and they can take arguments and return values.  
- Control structures: Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in JavaScript. Examples include if/else statements, switch statements, and loops like for and while.  
- Objects: JavaScript is an object-oriented language, and objects are used to represent data and behavior. Objects can be created using object literals or constructors.  
- Comments: Comments are used to add explanatory notes to JavaScript code. They are ignored by the browser and do not affect the behavior of the code.  

These are just a few of the many syntax fundamentals of JavaScript. By mastering these basics, you can start to build more complex JavaScript applications.
