JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is commonly used for data serialization, which is the process of converting data from one format to another for storage or transmission.

JSON syntax is based on JavaScript object notation, but it is language-independent and can be used with any programming language that has the ability to parse JSON. The basic elements of JSON are:

- Objects: Enclosed in curly braces `{}`, objects consist of a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, array, or another object.  
- Arrays: Enclosed in square brackets `[]`, arrays consist of an ordered collection of values, which can be a string, number, boolean, null, array, or object.  
- Strings: Enclosed in double quotes `""`, strings are a sequence of characters.  
- Numbers: JSON supports integer and floating-point numbers.  
- Boolean values: JSON has two boolean values, `true` and `false`.  
- Null: JSON has a null value, which represents a missing or undefined value.  

Here's an example of a JSON object:

```json
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "state": "CA",
    "zip": "12345"
  },
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "555-555-1234"
    },
    {
      "type": "work",
      "number": "555-555-5678"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, we have an object with several key-value pairs, including a nested object for the `address` and an array of objects for `phoneNumbers`.

JSON is commonly used for data exchange between a client and a server, as well as for data storage in databases and files. The JavaScript `JSON` object provides methods for converting JavaScript objects to and from JSON format, making it easy to work with JSON data in JavaScript applications.
