Transfer-Encoding is an HTTP header that specifies the type of encoding that has been applied to the message body in order to allow for its transfer between the client and the server.

Transfer-Encoding is used to support efficient transmission of large messages over the Internet. When the message body is large, the server can send the message in chunks, which allows the client to begin processing the response before the entire message has been received.

There are several types of transfer encodings, including:

- chunked: the message body is divided into a series of chunks, each preceded by its size in bytes, allowing the client to begin processing the response before the entire message has been received
- gzip: the message body is compressed using the gzip algorithm before being sent, reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred
- deflate: the message body is compressed using the deflate algorithm before being sent
- identity: no encoding has been applied to the message body, and it should be transmitted as-is

The Transfer-Encoding header is typically set by the server, indicating the type of encoding that has been applied to the message body. The client can then use this information to correctly decode the message body and process the response.

Transfer-Encoding is an important aspect of web performance optimization and can help to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the client and the server, thereby improving page load times and reducing bandwidth usage.
