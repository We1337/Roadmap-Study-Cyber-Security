The Host header is an HTTP request header that specifies the domain name of the server that the client is requesting a resource from.

When a client sends an HTTP request, it includes a Host header to indicate the domain name of the server it wants to communicate with. This is necessary because a single IP address can host multiple websites, so the Host header is used to identify which website the client is requesting a resource from.

For example, when a user enters a URL into their web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server specified in the URL, including the Host header with the domain name of the server. The server then uses this information to route the request to the appropriate website or virtual host.

The Host header is a required header for HTTP/1.1 requests, and its absence will result in a "400 Bad Request" error from the server.
