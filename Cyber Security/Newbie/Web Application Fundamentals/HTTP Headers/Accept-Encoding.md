Accept-Encoding is an HTTP request header that is sent by the client to indicate the types of encoding that are acceptable in the response.

Accept-Encoding is used to support efficient transmission of large messages over the Internet. When the message body is large, the server can send the message in a compressed format, which reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred.

The Accept-Encoding header contains a list of one or more encoding types that the client is willing to accept. Common encoding types include gzip and deflate.

When the server receives a request with an Accept-Encoding header, it can choose to encode the response in one of the accepted encoding types, or it can choose to send the response without any encoding. If the server chooses to encode the response, it includes the Content-Encoding header in the response, which indicates the type of encoding that has been applied to the message body.

The Accept-Encoding header is important for web performance optimization because it allows the server to send compressed responses to clients that support compression, thereby reducing the amount of data that needs to be transferred between the client and the server. This can help to improve page load times and reduce bandwidth usage.
