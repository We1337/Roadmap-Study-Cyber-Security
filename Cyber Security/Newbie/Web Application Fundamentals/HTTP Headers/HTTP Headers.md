HTTP headers are additional pieces of information that are sent along with an HTTP request or response message between a client (such as a web browser) and a server. HTTP headers provide additional context and instructions for handling the request or response.

HTTP headers consist of a key-value pair, where the key is the name of the header and the value is the corresponding data. Some commonly used HTTP headers include:

- Content-Type: specifies the format of the data being sent in the request or response, such as text, HTML, JSON, or binary data.
- User-Agent: provides information about the client making the request, such as the browser type and version, or the name and version of the application.
- Authorization: provides authentication credentials for accessing protected resources on the server, such as a username and password, or an access token.
- Accept: specifies the acceptable content types for the response, based on the MIME types supported by the client.
- Cache-Control: provides instructions for caching the response on the client or server side, such as the maximum age of the cached data or whether it can be stored in a shared cache.

HTTP headers can be added, modified, or removed by the client or server depending on the specific use case. Headers can be used for various purposes, such as controlling caching behavior, providing authentication and authorization information, enabling cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), or implementing security measures such as HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
