A cookie is a small piece of data that a website can store on a user's computer or mobile device. Cookies are sent between the client (such as a web browser) and server through HTTP headers, and are used to store information such as user preferences, login credentials, shopping cart contents, or tracking data.

When a user visits a website, the website can send a cookie to the user's browser and store it on the user's device. The cookie is then sent back to the server with subsequent requests from the same client, allowing the server to identify and personalize the user's experience.

Cookies can be set to expire after a specific time period or when the user closes their browser, or they can be persistent and stored on the user's device for a longer period of time.

There are several types of cookies, such as first-party cookies (set by the website being visited), third-party cookies (set by a different domain than the one being visited), session cookies (stored temporarily and deleted when the user closes their browser), and persistent cookies (stored on the user's device for a longer period of time).

Cookies have been subject to increasing scrutiny and regulation due to concerns around privacy and tracking. Most web browsers allow users to view and manage the cookies stored on their devices, and many also offer options to block or limit cookies. Additionally, some jurisdictions have implemented regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, which requires websites to obtain explicit user consent before setting non-essential cookies.
