X-Content-Type-Options is an HTTP security header that helps prevent MIME type sniffing attacks. When a browser receives a response from a server, it attempts to determine the MIME type of the content based on the Content-Type header. However, in some cases, attackers can manipulate this header to trick the browser into interpreting the content in unexpected ways.

For example, an attacker could send a file with a Content-Type header of `text/plain`, but actually include JavaScript code inside the file. If the browser interprets the file as JavaScript, it could execute the malicious code and compromise the user's system.

The X-Content-Type-Options header can help prevent this type of attack by instructing the browser to only interpret the content based on the MIME type specified in the Content-Type header, and to ignore any attempt to "sniff" the content type. There are two possible values for the header:

1. `nosniff`: This value indicates that the browser should not attempt to sniff the content type, and should only interpret the content based on the MIME type specified in the Content-Type header.
2. `none`: This value indicates that the browser should allow content type sniffing.

Here is an example of an X-Content-Type-Options header:

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

This header indicates that the browser should not attempt to sniff the content type, and should only interpret the content based on the MIME type specified in the Content-Type header.

It's important to note that not all browsers support the X-Content-Type-Options header, and some older browsers may not recognize it at all. Nevertheless, it can be a useful tool in a defense-in-depth strategy for web application security.
