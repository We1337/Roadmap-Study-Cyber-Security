X-XSS-Protection is an HTTP security header that instructs web browsers to enable their built-in cross-site scripting (XSS) filters. XSS attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious code into a web page, usually in the form of a script, that is then executed by a user's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal sensitive information, like passwords and credit card numbers, or to perform other actions on the user's behalf.

The X-XSS-Protection header can help mitigate the risk of XSS attacks by instructing browsers to automatically detect and block certain types of malicious code. When a browser receives a web page with this header, it will enable its XSS filter and attempt to block any suspicious content that may be present on the page.

Here is an example of an X-XSS-Protection header:

```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

This header enables the XSS filter and sets its mode to "block". If the browser detects any potentially malicious content, it will block the content from being displayed to the user.

It's important to note that X-XSS-Protection is not a foolproof defense against XSS attacks. Attackers can still find ways to circumvent browser filters, and some older browsers may not support the header at all. Nevertheless, it can be a useful tool in a defense-in-depth strategy for web application security.
