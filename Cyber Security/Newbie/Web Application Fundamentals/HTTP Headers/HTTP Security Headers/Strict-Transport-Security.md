Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) is an HTTP security header that instructs web browsers to only access a website using HTTPS, even if the user types in the website URL with HTTP in the address bar. This header helps to prevent man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker intercepts the communication between the user and the server, and can read or modify the data being transmitted.

When a web server sends the HSTS header with a specified time duration, the web browser remembers this information and enforces the use of HTTPS for subsequent visits to the same website during the specified time period. This means that if a user types in the website URL with HTTP, the web browser automatically changes it to HTTPS, and any further communication with the website is encrypted.

HSTS is particularly useful for websites that require high security, such as banking websites, online payment portals, and other sensitive applications. It can be implemented easily by adding the following HTTP header to the server's response:

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```

The `max-age` parameter specifies the time duration in seconds for which the browser should remember the HSTS policy, and the `includeSubDomains` parameter indicates that the policy should also be applied to all subdomains of the website.
