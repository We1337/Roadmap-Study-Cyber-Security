CSS frameworks are pre-designed collections of CSS files, HTML templates, and JavaScript code that can be used to quickly create consistent and visually appealing web pages. They provide a set of pre-defined styles and layout structures that can be easily customized to suit a specific design or branding.

Some popular CSS frameworks include:

1. Bootstrap: a widely used framework developed by Twitter, offering a variety of pre-designed UI elements and responsive layout options.
2. Foundation: a responsive framework developed by Zurb, offering a variety of customizable UI components and layout options.
3. Materialize: a framework based on Google's Material Design language, offering a variety of pre-designed UI elements and animations.
4. Bulma: a modern CSS framework that emphasizes simplicity and flexibility, offering a variety of customizable UI components and layout options.

CSS frameworks can be particularly useful for developers who want to create web pages quickly and efficiently, without having to write a lot of custom CSS code from scratch. They can also help ensure that a website's design is consistent across different pages and devices, and can be a useful tool for developers who are not expert designers. However, it is important to keep in mind that using a CSS framework can also result in websites that look generic or cookie-cutter, so it is important to customize the styles and layout to suit the needs of the specific project.
