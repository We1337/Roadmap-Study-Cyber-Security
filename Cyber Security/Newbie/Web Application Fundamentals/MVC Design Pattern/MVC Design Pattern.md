MVC (Model-View-Controller) is a design pattern commonly used in software engineering for developing user interfaces. The pattern separates an application into three interconnected components: the Model, the View, and the Controller.

- Model: The Model represents the data and business logic of the application. It manages the data, validates the input, and responds to requests from the Controller. It is responsible for all the application's behavior and rules.  
- View: The View represents the user interface of the application. It displays the data to the user and receives input from them. It is responsible for presenting the data in a way that the user can understand.  
- Controller: The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives input from the user through the View and uses the Model to process the input and update the View. It controls the flow of the application and decides which View to display based on the user's input.  

The advantages of using the MVC pattern are:

- Separation of concerns: The pattern separates the application into distinct components that handle different aspects of the application. This makes the code more modular, easier to understand, and maintainable.  
- Code reusability: The separation of concerns makes it possible to reuse code across different applications or components.  
- Testability: Each component can be tested independently, making it easier to test the application as a whole.  
- Flexibility: The pattern allows for changes to one component without affecting the others, making it easier to modify and update the application.  

MVC is widely used in web development frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails, Django, and ASP.NET, as well as in desktop and mobile applications.
