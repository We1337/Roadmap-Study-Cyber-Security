OPTIONS is an HTTP method used to determine the options and/or requirements associated with a resource, or the communication options available for a particular client-server interaction. The OPTIONS request is typically used to determine what methods are supported by a particular resource or to obtain information about the server's capabilities.

When a client makes an OPTIONS request, the server responds with an HTTP response that includes the headers describing the resource's capabilities. This information can include the allowed methods, supported content types, supported authentication methods, and other information that can be used by the client to perform subsequent requests.

Here is an example of an OPTIONS request:

```
OPTIONS /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.93 Safari/537.36
```

In this example, the client is making an OPTIONS request to determine the allowed methods for the `/api/users` resource. The server will respond with a list of allowed methods, which can include GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and others. This information can be used by the client to perform subsequent requests to the resource with the appropriate method.
