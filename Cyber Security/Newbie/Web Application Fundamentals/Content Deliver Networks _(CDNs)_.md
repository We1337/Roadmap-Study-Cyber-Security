A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a network of distributed servers that work together to deliver content, such as web pages, images, videos, and other files, to users more efficiently and reliably. CDNs store copies of the content on multiple servers located in different geographic regions and serve the content to users from the server that is closest to them. This reduces the latency and the number of hops between the user's device and the server, resulting in faster and more reliable content delivery.

CDNs use various techniques to optimize content delivery, such as caching, compression, and content routing. When a user requests content from a website that uses a CDN, the request is routed to the closest server that has a copy of the content. If the content is not cached on the server, the server requests the content from the origin server and caches it for future requests. Subsequent requests for the same content can be served directly from the CDN's cache, reducing the load on the origin server and improving the response time.

CDNs can also optimize content delivery by compressing the content to reduce the file size and the bandwidth usage, and by using content routing to direct users to the server that has the fastest response time. Some CDNs also provide advanced features, such as DDoS protection, SSL encryption, and load balancing, to improve the security and scalability of the content delivery.

CDNs are widely used by websites and applications that serve large volumes of content to global audiences, such as e-commerce sites, media companies, and social networks. They are also used by developers and organizations that want to improve the performance and reliability of their web applications, by offloading the content delivery to a specialized service that can handle it more efficiently.
