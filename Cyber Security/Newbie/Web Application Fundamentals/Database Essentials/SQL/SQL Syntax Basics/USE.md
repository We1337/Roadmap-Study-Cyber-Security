The USE statement is used to select a database to use within an SQL session. Once you have logged in to a database server, you may have multiple databases on that server that you can access. The USE statement allows you to select a specific database to work with within your current session.

The basic syntax of the USE statement is as follows:

```
USE database_name;
```

Here, `database_name` is the name of the database that you want to select.

After executing the USE statement, any subsequent SQL statements that you execute will be applied to the selected database. If you want to switch to a different database, you can simply execute another USE statement with the name of the new database.

It is important to note that different database management systems may have different rules regarding the use of the USE statement. For example, in MySQL, the USE statement is not transactional and can be executed even if there are active transactions in progress. However, in other database systems, the USE statement may be considered a transactional operation and may be subject to the same rules and restrictions as other SQL statements.
