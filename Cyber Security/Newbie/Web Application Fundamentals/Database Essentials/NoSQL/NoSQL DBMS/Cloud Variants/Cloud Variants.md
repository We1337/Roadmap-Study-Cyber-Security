There are several cloud variants that are commonly used in modern computing:

1. Public cloud: A public cloud is a type of cloud computing in which services are offered to multiple customers over the internet. Public cloud services are typically offered by third-party providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform. Public clouds are scalable, cost-effective, and offer a wide range of services, including infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS).
2. Private cloud: A private cloud is a type of cloud computing in which services are offered exclusively to a single organization or company. Private clouds can be managed internally by an organization or provided by a third-party provider. Private clouds offer greater control and security compared to public clouds, but can be more expensive to deploy and maintain.
3. Hybrid cloud: A hybrid cloud is a type of cloud computing that combines the use of public and private clouds. This allows organizations to take advantage of the benefits of both public and private clouds, such as scalability, cost-effectiveness, and control. Hybrid clouds can be used to run certain workloads in a public cloud while keeping sensitive data in a private cloud. 
4. Multi-cloud: A multi-cloud is a type of cloud computing in which an organization uses multiple cloud providers to host their applications and data. Multi-cloud strategies can help organizations avoid vendor lock-in, improve resiliency, and take advantage of the unique features offered by each cloud provider. 

Overall, each cloud variant offers unique benefits and trade-offs, and the best choice depends on an organization's specific needs and requirements.
