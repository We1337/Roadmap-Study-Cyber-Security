NoSQL databases are different from traditional relational databases in that they do not follow the relational model and do not use SQL for querying. Instead, they use their own query languages or APIs. Here are some basic syntax elements commonly used in NoSQL databases:

1. Collections: NoSQL databases use collections to store data, which are similar to tables in relational databases. A collection is a group of related documents or key-value pairs.
2. Documents: In a document-based NoSQL database, each record is stored as a document. A document is a JSON object that contains one or more key-value pairs, where each key is a field name and each value is the data associated with that field.
3. Keys: In a key-value NoSQL database, each record is stored as a key-value pair. The key is a unique identifier for the record, and the value is the data associated with that key.
4. Querying: NoSQL databases use their own query languages or APIs to retrieve data. The syntax and capabilities of these query languages vary depending on the database, but they generally allow you to specify filtering, sorting, and grouping criteria.
5. Indexes: In order to improve query performance, NoSQL databases use indexes to quickly locate data. Indexes can be created on one or more fields in a document or key-value pair.
6. Aggregation: Some NoSQL databases support aggregation functions, which allow you to group and perform calculations on data across multiple documents or key-value pairs. 

These are some basic syntax elements commonly used in NoSQL databases, but the specific syntax and capabilities of each database can vary greatly.
