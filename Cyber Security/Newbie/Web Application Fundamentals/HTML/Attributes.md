In web development, attributes are additional properties or characteristics that can be added to HTML elements to modify their behavior or appearance. Attributes are defined within the opening tag of an HTML element and consist of a name and a value.

Here are some common HTML attributes:

1. id: identifies an element with a unique name that can be used to target the element with JavaScript or CSS.
2. class: defines a group of elements with a shared style or behavior.
3. href: specifies the URL of a hyperlink.
4. src: specifies the URL of an image or other media file.
5. alt: provides alternative text for an image, which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded.
6. title: provides a tooltip when the user hovers over an element.
7. disabled: disables an input field or button.
8. checked: checks a checkbox or radio button by default.
9. value: sets the initial value of an input field.
10. style: sets inline CSS styles for an element.

Attributes can be used to add functionality and interactivity to web pages, and are an essential part of web development. It is important to use attributes correctly and according to the HTML specification to ensure proper functionality and cross-browser compatibility.
