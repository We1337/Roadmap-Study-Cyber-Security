Meta tags are snippets of HTML code that provide information about a web page to search engines and website visitors. They are placed in the head section of a web page and do not affect the visual appearance of the page. Meta tags can include information about the page title, description, keywords, author, and other details that help search engines understand what the page is about and how it should be indexed. Some common meta tags include the "title" tag, the "description" tag, and the "keywords" tag. Meta tags are important for search engine optimization (SEO) because they can help a web page rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs) by providing relevant information about the page's content to search engines.
