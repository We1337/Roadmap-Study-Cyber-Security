JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a type of security token that is used to authenticate and authorize users in web applications.

A JWT is essentially a compact, URL-safe string that contains a set of claims (i.e., pieces of information) about a user, such as their username, role, or email address. The token is generated by the server and sent to the client in response to a successful login request. The client can then include the token in subsequent requests to the server, allowing the server to verify the user's identity and grant access to protected resources.

A JWT consists of three parts, separated by dots:

- Header: Contains information about the type of token (i.e., JWT) and the cryptographic algorithm used to sign it.
- Payload: Contains the claims about the user, such as their username, role, or email address.
- Signature: Used to verify the integrity of the token and ensure that it has not been tampered with.

The JWT is typically signed using a secret key or public/private key pair, which ensures that the token can only be verified by the server that created it. This provides a secure way to transmit user authentication and authorization information between client and server without the need for server-side sessions.

JWTs have become a popular choice for implementing authentication and authorization in modern web applications because they are lightweight, easy to use, and can be transmitted over HTTP headers or query parameters. However, it is important to ensure that JWTs are used correctly and securely, and that the server validates all tokens before granting access to protected resources.
