JWS and JWE are both standards for securely transmitting data as JSON objects, but they differ in the type of data that they protect and the method of protection that they use.

JWS (JSON Web Signature) is used to digitally sign data in a JSON object, such as a JWT, to ensure its integrity and authenticity. A JWS consists of a header, payload, and signature, which are all encoded as JSON objects and then Base64url encoded to create a compact, URL-safe string. The JWS header specifies the algorithm used to create the signature, and the payload contains the data being signed. The signature is created by applying the specified algorithm to a combination of the header, payload, and a secret key known only to the signer. The resulting signature is included in the JWS, and can be used by the recipient to verify the integrity and authenticity of the data.

JWE (JSON Web Encryption) is used to encrypt data in a JSON object, to ensure its confidentiality and privacy. A JWE consists of a header, encrypted key, initialization vector, ciphertext, and authentication tag, which are all encoded as JSON objects and then Base64url encoded to create a compact, URL-safe string. The JWE header specifies the encryption algorithm and key management algorithm used to encrypt the data, and the encrypted key is used to protect the key that was used to encrypt the data. The initialization vector and ciphertext are used to encrypt the data itself, and the authentication tag is used to verify the integrity of the encrypted data.

In summary, JWS is used to sign data to ensure its authenticity and integrity, while JWE is used to encrypt data to ensure its confidentiality and privacy. Both standards provide a secure way to transmit JSON data over the internet, and they can be used together to provide end-to-end security for sensitive data.
