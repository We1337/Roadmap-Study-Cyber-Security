"Expires" is a parameter that can be set for HTTP cookies to specify a specific date and time at which the cookie should expire and be deleted by the web browser.

When a cookie is set with an "Expires" parameter, the browser will automatically remove the cookie from its storage once the specified expiration date and time have passed. This can be useful for implementing certain types of functionality, such as keeping a user logged in for a specific period of time, or remembering their preferences for future visits.

The value of the "Expires" parameter should be set as a Unix timestamp, which represents the number of seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC. This can be generated using programming languages like JavaScript or PHP, or using online tools and calculators.

In modern web development, the "Expires" parameter has largely been replaced by the "Max-Age" parameter, which allows cookies to specify their lifetime in seconds relative to the time the cookie was created, rather than an absolute expiration date. However, the "Expires" parameter is still supported by most web browsers and may be used in certain legacy applications.
