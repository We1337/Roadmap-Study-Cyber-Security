"SameSite" is an attribute that can be set for HTTP cookies to control whether or not they are sent with cross-site requests.

When a cookie is set with a "SameSite" attribute, it indicates that the cookie should only be sent with requests that originate from the same site as the one that set the cookie. This can help to prevent certain types of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks, in which a malicious website tries to impersonate a user on another website by making unauthorized requests using their existing authentication credentials.

There are three possible values for the SameSite attribute:

- "Strict": Cookies are only sent in first-party contexts (i.e., requests initiated by the same site as the one that set the cookie).
- "Lax": Cookies are sent with cross-site GET requests, but not with POST or other non-safe methods.
- "None": Cookies are sent with all cross-site requests. However, the "None" value can only be used if the cookie is also set with the "Secure" attribute, indicating that it should only be sent over HTTPS connections.

The SameSite attribute is supported by most modern web browsers, and it is becoming increasingly common for websites to use it to improve security and protect user privacy.
