The Same-Origin Policy (SOP) is a security feature implemented in web browsers to prevent malicious scripts or web pages from accessing data from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the one that served the script or page.

In simple terms, the SOP restricts web pages from making requests to domains other than the one that served them. This is done to prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS), clickjacking, and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), where an attacker attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in the user's browser to steal sensitive information or execute malicious code.

The SOP works by enforcing a set of rules that web pages must follow when making cross-origin requests. These rules require that:

1. The protocol (http/https) of the requested resource must match the protocol of the web page that made the request.
2. The domain name of the requested resource must match the domain name of the web page that made the request.
3. The port number of the requested resource must match the port number of the web page that made the request (or be absent, which implies port 80 for http and port 443 for https).

If any of these rules are violated, the browser will block the request and prevent the web page from accessing the requested resource.

However, the SOP can be relaxed in some cases using techniques like Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), which allow web pages to make cross-origin requests under certain conditions, and JSONP (JSON with Padding), which uses a script tag to bypass the SOP and load resources from other domains.

Overall, the SOP is a crucial security feature that helps protect users from malicious attacks by restricting the ability of web pages to access resources from other domains. Developers should be aware of the SOP when building web applications and follow best practices to ensure the security of their applications.
