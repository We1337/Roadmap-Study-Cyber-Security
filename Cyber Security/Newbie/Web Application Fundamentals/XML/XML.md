XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a markup language that is used to store and transport data. XML is designed to be both human-readable and machine-readable, which means that it can be easily understood by both humans and computers.

In XML, data is stored in tags, which are surrounded by angle brackets. Tags can be nested within other tags, forming a hierarchy of data. Each tag can also have attributes, which provide additional information about the data.

XML is used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Storing and transporting data: XML can be used to store data in a structured format that can be easily parsed by computer programs.  
- Web development: XML is often used in conjunction with other web technologies, such as HTML and CSS, to create dynamic web applications.  
- Configuration files: Many applications use XML files to store configuration settings, such as database connection information or application settings.  
- Interoperability: XML is a standard format that can be used by different applications and systems, making it a useful tool for exchanging data between different systems.  

Overall, XML provides a flexible and powerful way to store and transport data in a standardized format.
