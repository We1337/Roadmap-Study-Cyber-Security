In the context of network security and authentication protocols, a "Supplicant Nonce" (SNonce) refers to a random value generated by a supplicant entity during the authentication process.

The SNonce is typically used in the 4-way handshake process of WPA/WPA2, where it is exchanged between the client device (supplicant) and the access point (AP). The SNonce serves as a challenge to the AP, which uses it along with other parameters to derive the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) during the key exchange.

By using a random SNonce, the supplicant ensures the freshness and uniqueness of the authentication process, making it resistant to replay attacks and improving the security of the communication.

It's important to note that the SNonce is different from the ANonce (Authenticator Nonce), which is a random value generated by the AP. The combination of both the SNonce and ANonce is used in the key derivation process to establish a shared session key between the client and the access point.

In summary, the SNonce is a vital component in the secure authentication and key exchange process, contributing to the integrity and confidentiality of communication between the supplicant (client) and the access point.
