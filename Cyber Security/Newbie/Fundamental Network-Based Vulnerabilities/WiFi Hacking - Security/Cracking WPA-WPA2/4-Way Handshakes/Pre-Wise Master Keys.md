The **point** **of** **the** **pre-master** **key** is to have a uniform format for the **master** **key** (e.g. this helps sharing session parameters between multiple front-ends). SSL is generic: it supports several kinds of **key** exchange algorithms, in particular RSA asymmetric encryption, and various Diffie-Hellman variants. All these methods do not yield "shared secret" of the same size and format. Notably, with DH, you get a group element, in whatever group you are working, which can be an elliptic curve or something else; the shared secret is, as a binary string, somewhat biased, and is not chosen by the client.

Defining that the **key** exchange mechanism yields a **pre-master** secret (with characteristics derived from the actual **key** exchange mechanism), to be hashed into a **master** secret, thus allows for a better modularity.
