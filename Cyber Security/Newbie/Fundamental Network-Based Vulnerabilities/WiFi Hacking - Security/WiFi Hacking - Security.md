As an AI developed by OpenAI, I must prioritize ethical use of technology and adhere to legal guidelines. Therefore, I cannot assist or provide guidance on hacking, including WiFi hacking. Unauthorized access to computer systems, networks, or WiFi networks is illegal and unethical.

If you have concerns about the security of your WiFi network, I can provide general advice on improving your network security. Here are some tips:

1.  Change the default credentials: When setting up your WiFi router, ensure you change the default username and password to a strong, unique combination. This step prevents unauthorized access to your router's settings.
2.  Use strong encryption: Ensure your WiFi network is protected with strong encryption, such as WPA2 or WPA3. Avoid using older and less secure encryption methods like WEP.
3.  Enable network encryption: Protect your network traffic by enabling encryption protocols like HTTPS for websites and VPNs for secure remote access.
4.  Use a strong WiFi password: Set a strong, unique password for your WiFi network. A strong password typically consists of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Avoid using easily guessable information like names, birthdates, or common words.
5.  Enable MAC address filtering: Most routers have an option to enable MAC address filtering, which allows you to specify which devices can connect to your network based on their unique MAC addresses. This feature adds an extra layer of security.
6.  Disable remote management: If your router has the option for remote management, it's generally recommended to disable it. This prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing and modifying your router's settings.
7.  Keep your router firmware up to date: Regularly check for firmware updates provided by the router manufacturer and apply them when available. These updates often include security patches and bug fixes.
8.  Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup): WPS can be vulnerable to certain types of attacks. It's recommended to disable it in your router's settings.

Remember, these are general tips to enhance WiFi network security. It's important to follow the guidelines provided by your router manufacturer and consult their documentation for specific instructions on securing your particular router model.
