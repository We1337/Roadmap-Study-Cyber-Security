Windows Active Directory (AD) is a directory service that is widely used for centralized authentication, authorization, and management of user accounts and resources in Windows-based networks. However, it can also be a target for various attacks if not properly secured. Here are some common Active Directory attacks:

1.  Password Attacks: Attackers may attempt to compromise user accounts by using password attacks such as brute force, dictionary attacks, or password spraying. These attacks aim to guess or crack weak passwords to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
2.  Pass-the-Hash (PtH) Attacks: PtH attacks involve stealing the hashed password values stored in the Active Directory database and then using those hashes to authenticate as the user without knowing the actual password. This can be done by capturing the hashes from memory or using tools like Mimikatz.
3.  Kerberos Attacks: Kerberos is the authentication protocol used in Active Directory. Attackers may target weaknesses in the Kerberos protocol to perform attacks such as Kerberos Golden Ticket attacks or Silver Ticket attacks, which allow them to forge valid authentication tickets and gain unauthorized access to network resources.
4.  Domain Enumeration: Attackers may perform reconnaissance by enumerating Active Directory objects, such as user accounts, groups, and permissions, to gather information about the network structure and potential targets for further attacks.
5.  Domain Controller Compromise: The compromise of a domain controller can lead to a complete compromise of the Active Directory environment. Attackers may attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in domain controllers, gain administrative access, or escalate privileges to control the domain.
6.  Domain Trust Exploitation: If multiple Active Directory domains are connected through trusts, attackers may target weak or misconfigured trust relationships to gain unauthorized access to resources in trusted domains.
7.  Group Policy Manipulation: Attackers may target Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to manipulate security settings, deploy malicious scripts, or escalate privileges on compromised systems.

To protect against Active Directory attacks, consider the following security measures:

1.  Strong Password Policies: Enforce strong password policies, including complex passwords, regular password changes, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
2.  Regular Patching and Updates: Keep all domain controllers and servers up to date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
3.  Least Privilege Principle: Assign users and groups with the least privileges necessary to perform their tasks. Regularly review and remove unnecessary permissions.
4.  Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust logging and monitoring solutions to detect and respond to suspicious activities, such as failed logins, privilege escalations, or abnormal behavior.
5.  Use Secure Protocols: Configure Active Directory to use secure protocols like LDAP over SSL/TLS (LDAPS) and enable Kerberos pre-authentication.
6.  Strong Network Segmentation: Segment the network and apply access controls to limit lateral movement and contain potential attacks.
7.  Regular Security Assessments: Conduct regular security assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning to identify and address potential weaknesses in the Active Directory environment.

It is crucial to follow best practices, implement appropriate security controls, and stay updated with the latest security guidance from Microsoft to maintain a secure Active Directory infrastructure.
