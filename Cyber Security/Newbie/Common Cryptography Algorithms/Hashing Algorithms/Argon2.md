Argon2 is a state-of-the-art password hashing algorithm that was selected as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition in 2015. It is designed specifically for the purpose of securely hashing passwords and deriving cryptographic keys. The goal of Argon2 is to provide strong resistance against various types of attacks, including brute-force, dictionary, and GPU-based attacks.

The key features and characteristics of Argon2 include:

1.  Memory-hardness: Argon2 is designed to be computationally intensive with a significant memory requirement. It aims to make it more difficult and costly for attackers to perform parallel and time-memory trade-off attacks, thus increasing the cost of brute-forcing passwords.
2.  Resistance against side-channel attacks: Argon2 is designed to be resistant to side-channel attacks, which are attacks that exploit information leaked during the execution of a cryptographic algorithm. By mitigating these attacks, Argon2 provides an additional layer of security.
3.  Configurable parameters: Argon2 offers various configurable parameters to adjust its computational and memory requirements, including the degree of parallelism, memory cost, and the number of iterations. This flexibility allows the algorithm to be adaptable to different platforms and security requirements.
4.  Different variants: Argon2 comes in three variants: Argon2d, Argon2i, and Argon2id. Argon2d is suitable for applications with no threat of side-channel attacks, Argon2i is resistant to side-channel attacks, and Argon2id is a hybrid variant that provides a balance between the two. The choice of variant depends on the specific security requirements of the application.
5.  Resistance against trade-off attacks: Argon2 is designed to resist time-memory trade-off attacks, where an attacker precomputes a table of hashes in advance to speed up the cracking process. By using a large amount of memory, Argon2 makes such attacks more costly and less practical.

Argon2 is widely regarded as a secure and reliable password hashing algorithm. It is recommended for securely storing and hashing passwords in various applications and systems, including web applications, operating systems, databases, and cryptographic key derivation functions. Its selection as the winner of the Password Hashing Competition and its adoption by industry experts and security communities demonstrate its strength and effectiveness in protecting sensitive credentials.
