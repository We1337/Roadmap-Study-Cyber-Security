CMS (Content Management System) scanners are tools used to identify the underlying CMS or framework being used by a website. They automate the process of scanning a website and analyzing its structure, code, and behavior to determine the CMS being employed. These scanners can be helpful for security researchers, website administrators, and penetration testers to assess the security posture of a website and identify any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses specific to the CMS in use.

Here are a few popular CMS scanners:

1. WPScan: WPScan is a widely used WordPress vulnerability scanner. It identifies WordPress installations, enumerates plugins and themes, and checks for known vulnerabilities. 
2. CMSmap: CMSmap is a Python-based scanner that can identify the CMS being used on a website. It supports various CMS platforms such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, and many others. It also provides additional functionality for vulnerability scanning and exploitation. 
3. WhatWeb: WhatWeb is a versatile web scanner that can identify CMS platforms, frameworks, and server software by analyzing HTTP responses and HTML content. It has support for a wide range of CMS platforms and technologies. 
4. JoomScan: JoomScan is a specialized Joomla vulnerability scanner. It helps identify Joomla installations, scan for vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations for securing the Joomla website.
5. Droopescan: Droopescan is a scanner designed for Drupal websites. It can identify Drupal installations, enumerate modules, and scan for known vulnerabilities in the Drupal ecosystem. 

It's important to note that CMS scanners should be used responsibly and with proper authorization. Unauthorized scanning or testing of websites can potentially lead to legal consequences. Always ensure you have permission from the website owner before performing any scanning activities and adhere to responsible disclosure practices if you discover any vulnerabilities.

Additionally, keep in mind that CMS scanners can only provide automated assessments and may not identify all vulnerabilities or issues. Manual testing and analysis are often required to gain a comprehensive understanding of a website's security posture.
