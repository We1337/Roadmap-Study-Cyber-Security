API endpoints are specific URLs or URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) that are used to interact with an API (Application Programming Interface). API endpoints define the functionality and operations that can be performed by making HTTP requests to those URLs.

Here are a few common types of API endpoints:

1. **GET endpoints**: These endpoints are used to retrieve data or perform read operations. Typically, you send a GET request to the API endpoint, and the server responds with the requested data.
2. **POST endpoints**: POST endpoints are used to submit or create new data on the server. You send a POST request to the API endpoint, along with the data to be created or updated, and the server processes and stores that data.
3. **PUT or PATCH endpoints**: PUT and PATCH endpoints are used to update existing data on the server. You send a PUT or PATCH request to the API endpoint, specifying the data to be modified, and the server updates the corresponding resource accordingly.
4. **DELETE endpoints**: DELETE endpoints are used to delete or remove data from the server. You send a DELETE request to the API endpoint, specifying the resource or data to be deleted, and the server performs the deletion operation.
5. **Custom endpoints**: APIs may define custom endpoints to provide specific functionality beyond the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. These endpoints can be used for various purposes, such as performing complex queries, executing specialized actions, or retrieving aggregated data.

API endpoints are typically documented by the API provider, and the documentation describes the purpose, expected parameters, request format, and response format for each endpoint. The documentation also often includes information about authentication requirements, rate limiting, and any additional considerations for interacting with the API.

When working with an API, it's essential to refer to the API documentation to understand the available endpoints and their usage. This documentation helps developers effectively interact with the API and utilize its functionality in their applications.
