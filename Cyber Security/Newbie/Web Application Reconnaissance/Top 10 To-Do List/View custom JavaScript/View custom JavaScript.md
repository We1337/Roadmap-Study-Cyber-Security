To view custom JavaScript code used in a webpage, you can follow these steps:

1. **View page source**: Right-click on the webpage you want to inspect and select "View Page Source" or a similar option in your web browser. This will open a new tab or window displaying the HTML source code of the page.
2. **Search for JavaScript references**: Look for `<script>` tags within the HTML source code. These tags are used to include JavaScript code in the webpage. The JavaScript code may be embedded directly within the `<script>` tags or referenced from external JavaScript files using the `src` attribute.
3. **Inspect inline JavaScript**: If the JavaScript code is embedded directly within the `<script>` tags, you can view and analyze it directly in the HTML source code. Look for `<script>` tags without the `src` attribute, and the JavaScript code will be present between the opening and closing `<script>` tags.
4. **Retrieve external JavaScript files**: If the JavaScript code is loaded from external files using the `src` attribute of `<script>` tags, you can identify the URLs of these files within the HTML source code. Copy the URL of the external JavaScript file(s) and open them in new tabs to view the code.
5. **Use browser developer tools**: Another approach is to utilize the developer tools built into modern web browsers. You can access these tools by right-clicking on the webpage and selecting "Inspect" or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (or Command+Option+I on Mac) to open the browser's developer console. In the developer tools, navigate to the "Sources" or "Network" tab to view and analyze the JavaScript code.
6. **Search for specific JavaScript files**: If you have identified specific JavaScript files used by the webpage, you can search for them directly using their URLs. Open the URL of the JavaScript file in a new tab, and the browser will display the code for you to examine.

By following these steps, you should be able to view the custom JavaScript code used in the webpage and analyze its functionality. It's important to note that some JavaScript code may be minified or obfuscated to make it harder to understand. In such cases, you can use code beautifiers or formatting tools to make the code more readable.
