As an AI language model, I cannot browse the internet or provide real-time information. My responses are based on the knowledge available up until September 2021 and do not include the ability to search for or provide information on specific unpatched CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

To research unpatched CVEs, I recommend utilizing dedicated vulnerability databases, security advisories, and other reliable sources for up-to-date information on known vulnerabilities. Here are some reputable sources where you can find information about CVEs and their current patch status:

1. **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: The NVD is a U.S. government repository that provides comprehensive information on vulnerabilities. It includes details about CVEs, their severity, affected software, and links to related resources. You can search for specific CVEs and check their patch status.
2. **CVE Details**: CVE Details is a freely available online database that provides information on publicly known vulnerabilities. It offers details about CVEs, including their description, severity, and affected software. You can search for specific CVEs to get more information about their current status.
3. **Vendor Security Advisories**: Check the security advisories and bulletins published by software vendors. Many vendors maintain their own security portals or mailing lists to communicate security updates, patches, and information about known vulnerabilities affecting their products.
4. **Security News Websites and Blogs**: Stay informed by regularly following security news websites and blogs that cover vulnerability disclosures and provide updates on the latest security issues. Examples of such websites include SecurityFocus, Threatpost, and The Hacker News.

When researching unpatched CVEs, it's important to remember that responsible disclosure is crucial. If you discover a vulnerability that has not been patched, it's recommended to follow responsible disclosure practices by notifying the affected vendor or the relevant CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team). This allows them to work on a patch and release it before public disclosure to minimize the potential risks.

Always prioritize your cybersecurity efforts by keeping your systems and software up to date with the latest patches and security updates.
