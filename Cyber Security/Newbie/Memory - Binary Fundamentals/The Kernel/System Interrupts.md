System interrupts are events that interrupt the normal execution of a computer system's processor to handle specific tasks or events. When an interrupt occurs, the processor suspends its current activities and transfers control to a specific routine or interrupt handler that handles the interrupt. These interrupts can be generated by both software and hardware.

Here are a few common types of system interrupts:

1. Hardware Interrupts: These interrupts are triggered by external hardware devices such as keyboards, mice, disk drives, network cards, or timers. For example, when you press a key on your keyboard, a hardware interrupt is generated to inform the processor that there is new input data.
2. Software Interrupts: These interrupts are generated by software to request services from the operating system or to perform a specific function. For instance, when a program needs to read data from a file, it may generate a software interrupt to request the operating system's file system services.

3. Exception Interrupts: Also known as traps or faults, these interrupts are caused by exceptional conditions that occur during program execution. Examples include divide-by-zero errors, illegal instruction execution, or page faults in virtual memory systems. Exception interrupts are used to handle error conditions and ensure the system's stability.

4. System Call Interrupts: These interrupts are a type of software interrupt that occurs when a program requests a service from the operating system. When a program needs to perform tasks that require higher privileges or access to system resources, it invokes a system call, which triggers a system call interrupt.

The interrupt handling mechanism is an integral part of an operating system, as it allows the system to respond to external events, provide services, and handle errors. Upon receiving an interrupt, the processor saves its current state, switches to the interrupt handler routine, and once the interrupt is handled, it returns to the interrupted task and restores its previous state. This process ensures efficient multitasking and system responsiveness.
