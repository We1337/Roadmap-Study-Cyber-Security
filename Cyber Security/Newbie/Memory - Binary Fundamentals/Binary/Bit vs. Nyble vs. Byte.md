Bit, nybble (also spelled nibble), and byte are units of digital information storage commonly used in computing and digital systems. Here's a comparison of these units:

1. Bit (Binary Digit):
A bit is the smallest unit of digital information. It represents a binary value, which can be either 0 or 1. Bits are used to store and transmit data in computers and other digital devices. They are often combined to form larger units of information.

2. Nybble (Nibble):
A nybble, also known as a nibble, is a unit of information that consists of four bits. It represents a half-byte or a single hexadecimal digit (0 to 15). Nybbles are commonly used in computing when dealing with hexadecimal notation, as it takes four bits to represent each digit.

3. Byte:
A byte is a unit of information that consists of eight bits. It is the most common unit of storage in computer systems and is used to represent a single character, such as a letter or a number. Bytes provide a convenient way to represent and process data in most computer architectures. In addition to representing characters, bytes are also used to store numerical values, instructions, and other types of data.

Comparison:
- A nybble is half the size of a byte, containing four bits, while a byte contains eight bits.
- A byte can represent a wider range of values and is the fundamental unit of storage in most computer systems.
- Nybbles are primarily used in hexadecimal notation, where each digit is represented by a nybble.
- Bits are the basic building blocks of information and are used for low-level data storage and transmission.

In summary, a bit is the smallest unit of information, a nybble is a group of four bits or half a byte, and a byte is a group of eight bits. Bytes are the most commonly used unit of storage, while nybbles are useful for representing hexadecimal digits.
