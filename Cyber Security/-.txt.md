The ".txt" file extension typically refers to plain text files, which contain unformatted text without any special formatting or styling. .txt files are simple and widely supported, and they can be created and edited using basic text editors or specialized text editing software.

.txt files are often used for storing and sharing plain text information, such as code snippets, configuration files, logs, and other types of textual data. They can be opened and edited using a wide range of text editing applications, including built-in text editors in operating systems, popular text editors like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), and gedit (Linux), as well as more advanced text editors or integrated development environments (IDEs) used for programming and software development.

.txt files are platform-agnostic, meaning they can be opened and edited on different operating systems without compatibility issues. They do not support any formatting or rich text features, and the content is displayed as plain text without any font styles, colors, or other formatting elements. .txt files are typically used for storing and sharing text-based content in a simple and lightweight format that can be easily read and processed by various applications and systems.
