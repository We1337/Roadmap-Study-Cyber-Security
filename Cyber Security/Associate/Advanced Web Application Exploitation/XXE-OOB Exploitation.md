Out-of-Band XXE exploitation involves using external entities to communicate with a controlled server or external service in order to gather information. This can be useful when direct interaction with the exploited system is not possible due to network restrictions or security measures. Here are some key points to consider in your research:

1. **XXE Basics**: Ensure you have a strong understanding of how XXE vulnerabilities work. These vulnerabilities arise when an application processes XML input containing references to external entities.
2. **OOB Techniques**: Research and experiment with various out-of-band techniques that leverage external entities to interact with external services. This might include sending requests to your own controlled server.
3. **Payload Crafting**: Develop payloads that exploit XXE vulnerabilities and include references to external entities that trigger interactions with your OOB server. Craft these payloads based on the application's behavior and context.
4. **Interaction Types**: Explore different ways to use OOB XXE to gather information, such as exfiltrating data, performing SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), and identifying network characteristics.
5. **Proof of Concept (PoC)**: Create well-documented PoCs that demonstrate the exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities using OOB techniques. Clearly show how the attack works and how the external interaction is triggered.
6. **Lab Environment**: Set up a controlled lab environment for your research to avoid affecting real systems or networks. Never perform tests on systems without proper authorization.
7. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Always adhere to legal and ethical standards when conducting security research. Obtain proper authorization to test systems, and respect the boundaries set by organizations.
8. **Responsible Disclosure**: If you discover vulnerabilities during your research, follow responsible disclosure practices. Notify the affected organization about the vulnerability and give them a chance to address it before publicly sharing your findings.
9. **Security Community Involvement**: Engage with the security community, attend conferences, and participate in discussions related to XXE vulnerabilities and OOB techniques. Collaboration can enhance your understanding and knowledge.
