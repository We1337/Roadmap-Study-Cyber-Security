When researching the security of PDF file uploads, you might want to explore areas where vulnerabilities could exist and understand how attackers might attempt to exploit them. Here are some aspects to consider in your research:

1. **File Validation**: Investigate how the application validates the uploaded PDF files. Look for potential weaknesses in the validation process that could allow malicious PDFs to bypass security checks.
2. **File Parsing**: Analyze how the application parses and processes the content of uploaded PDF files. Malformed or specially crafted PDFs could potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing process.
3. **Embedded Scripts**: PDF files can contain scripts that might execute when the PDF is opened. Research how the application handles potentially malicious scripts within PDF files.
4. **PDF Exploits**: Examine known vulnerabilities in PDF file formats that have been exploited in the past. This can help you understand common attack vectors and how they might be prevented.
5. **Content Disposition**: Study how the application handles the "Content-Disposition" header when serving uploaded PDF files. Improper handling could lead to unintended content execution.
6. **PDF Metadata**: Explore how the application handles metadata and annotations within PDF files. Attackers might embed malicious data in these areas.
7. **File Conversion**: If the application converts PDF files to other formats (e.g., images), investigate whether the conversion process introduces vulnerabilities.
8. **Privilege Escalation**: Research whether attackers could exploit vulnerabilities in the PDF viewer or processing library to gain unauthorized access or escalate privileges.
9. **Encryption and Signing**: Understand how the application handles encrypted and digitally signed PDFs. Vulnerabilities in encryption or signing mechanisms could lead to unauthorized access.
10. **Mitigation Strategies**: Identify potential mitigation strategies, such as implementing proper file validation, using trusted PDF libraries, and implementing sandboxing techniques for PDF processing.
