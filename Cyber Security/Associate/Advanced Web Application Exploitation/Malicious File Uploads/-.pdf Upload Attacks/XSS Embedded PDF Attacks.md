XSS attacks occur when an application doesn't properly validate or sanitize user inputs and allows malicious scripts to be executed within the context of a user's browser. Embedded PDFs can be used as a delivery vector for such attacks. Here are some points to consider in your research:

1. **PDF Scripting**: Investigate whether PDF files can contain scripts, and if so, how they can be executed when the PDF is opened in a browser or PDF viewer.
2. **Script Injection**: Research how an attacker might inject malicious scripts into PDF files, targeting vulnerabilities in how the PDF is processed or displayed.
3. **PDF Metadata and Annotations**: Explore whether metadata, annotations, or other parts of a PDF file can be used to inject scripts or execute code when the PDF is opened.
4. **PDF Viewing Platforms**: Examine how different PDF viewers and browsers handle embedded scripts in PDFs. Differences in behavior could impact the effectiveness of an attack.
5. **Contextual Execution**: Understand the context in which the PDF is displayed or accessed within an application. The execution environment could affect the impact of an XSS attack.
6. **Reflected vs. Stored XSS**: Differentiate between reflected and stored XSS attacks. Understand how an attacker might trigger these attacks using embedded PDFs.
7. **Payload Encoding**: Investigate how an attacker might encode or obfuscate their payload to bypass security filters while embedding it in the PDF.
8. **Mitigation Strategies**: Identify possible mitigation strategies to prevent XSS attacks involving embedded PDF files. This might include input validation, output encoding, and proper handling of user-generated content.
9. **Secure PDF Generation**: Consider exploring best practices for generating PDF files with embedded content to minimize the risk of introducing XSS vulnerabilities.
