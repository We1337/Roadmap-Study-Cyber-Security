XXE attacks occur when an application parses XML data that includes external entities, potentially leading to information disclosure, denial of service, or other security issues. Here are some points to consider in your research involving XXE attacks with embedded PDF files:

1. **XML Parsing**: Investigate how the application parses XML data that includes external entities, and understand the context in which XML data is processed.
2. **External Entity Definition**: Explore how you can define external entities within XML documents and whether these entities can reference external resources, including embedded PDF files.
3. **PDF Embedding**: Research whether PDF files can be embedded within XML documents and how those files are processed when the XML is parsed.
4. **Data Retrieval**: Understand how an attacker might use XXE to retrieve sensitive information from the server, potentially including content from embedded PDFs.
5. **DoS Attacks**: Examine whether XXE attacks involving embedded PDF files can lead to denial of service (DoS) situations due to resource consumption.
6. **Contextual Considerations**: Analyze how the XML data is used within the application. Depending on the context, the impact of an XXE attack involving embedded PDFs could vary.
7. **Payload Construction**: Research how an attacker could construct payloads to exploit XXE vulnerabilities involving embedded PDFs.
8. **Mitigation Strategies**: Identify possible mitigation strategies to prevent XXE attacks. This might include disabling external entity resolution, input validation, and proper XML parsing.
9. **Secure XML Processing**: Explore best practices for securely processing XML data to mitigate the risk of XXE vulnerabilities.
