When investigating security vulnerabilities related to document uploads, including .doc files, it's important to focus on understanding potential risks and how attackers might exploit them. Here are some aspects to consider:

1. **File Validation**: Examine how the application validates and processes .doc files during upload. Look for potential weaknesses that could allow malicious files to bypass security checks.
2. **Macro Execution**: Investigate how the application handles macros within .doc files. Malicious macros can be used to execute arbitrary code when the document is opened.
3. **Embedded Content**: Research whether .doc files can contain embedded objects, scripts, or other content that might pose security risks when opened.
4. **Document Parsing**: Analyze how the application parses and renders the content of .doc files. Vulnerabilities in the parsing process can lead to various types of attacks.
5. **Client-Side Attacks**: Explore scenarios where a user might be tricked into downloading and opening a malicious .doc file. This could lead to client-side attacks such as code execution or information disclosure.
6. **File Format Exploits**: Investigate known vulnerabilities and exploits related to the .doc file format. Understanding historical attack vectors can help inform your research.
7. **Data Leakage**: Consider scenarios where a malicious .doc file could lead to data leakage or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
8. **Mitigation Strategies**: Identify potential mitigation strategies to prevent .doc upload attacks. This might involve analyzing the file's structure, blocking certain features, and implementing proper validation and sanitization.
9. **Secure Document Processing**: Research best practices for securely processing and rendering .doc files to reduce the risk of exploitation.
