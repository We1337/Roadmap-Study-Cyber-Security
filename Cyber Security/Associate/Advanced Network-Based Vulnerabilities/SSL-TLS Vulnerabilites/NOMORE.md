It seems like you might be referring to the vulnerabilities associated with SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security). Both SSL and TLS are cryptographic protocols used to secure communication over a computer network, commonly the internet.

Over the years, several vulnerabilities have been identified in these protocols, leading to the development of newer versions with stronger security features. Some notable vulnerabilities include POODLE, Heartbleed, BEAST, and others. However, it's important to note that security is an evolving field, and new vulnerabilities may be discovered over time.

To mitigate these vulnerabilities and enhance security, it is crucial to use the latest and most secure versions of SSL or TLS. As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, TLS 1.3 is considered one of the most secure versions.

It's essential to stay informed about the latest developments in cryptography and security practices, regularly update software and systems, and adhere to best practices for secure communication.
