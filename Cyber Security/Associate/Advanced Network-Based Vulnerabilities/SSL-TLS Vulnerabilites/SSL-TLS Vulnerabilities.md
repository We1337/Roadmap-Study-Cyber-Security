As of my last knowledge update in September 2021, there were several known vulnerabilities and attacks associated with the SSL/TLS protocols used to secure internet communications. Keep in mind that the situation may have evolved since then, and I recommend checking the latest sources for up-to-date information. Here are some SSL/TLS vulnerabilities that were known up until my last update:

1. **POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption)**:
   This attack targets SSLv3 and TLSv1.0, exploiting a vulnerability that allows attackers to decrypt parts of the communication between a client and a server. The attack takes advantage of the way SSLv3 handles padding in the encryption process.
2. **Heartbleed**:
   Heartbleed is a serious vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library. It allows an attacker to access memory from a server, potentially revealing sensitive data such as private keys, passwords, and more.
3. **BEAST (Browser Exploit Against SSL/TLS)**:
   BEAST is a vulnerability that affects the encryption of SSL/TLS when used with certain block cipher modes. It allows an attacker to decrypt parts of the communication between a client and a server.
4. **CRIME (Compression Ratio Info-leak Made Easy)**:
   CRIME takes advantage of the compression used in SSL/TLS to leak information about the plaintext data. By observing the change in the size of the compressed data, an attacker can infer information about the original data.
5. **DROWN (Decrypting RSA with Obsolete and Weakened Encryption)**:
   DROWN is an attack that exploits servers supporting SSLv2 even if they also support modern protocols. By leveraging weaknesses in SSLv2, an attacker can decrypt TLS connections.
6. **FREAK (Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys)**:
   FREAK is a vulnerability that allows an attacker to force a downgrade of encryption on a secure connection to a weak export-grade encryption. This could make it easier to crack the encryption and intercept the communication.
7. **Logjam**:
   Logjam attack leverages weak Diffie-Hellman keys to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and decrypt secure communications. It targets the use of 512-bit export-grade Diffie-Hellman keys, which were once considered secure but are now susceptible to attacks.
8. **SLOTH (Security Losses from Obsolete and Truncated Transcript Hashes)**:
   SLOTH is an attack that targets the MAC-then-encrypt construction of some TLS cipher suites. It can lead to various security vulnerabilities.
9. **BREACH**:
   BREACH is an attack that takes advantage of the compression in HTTPS responses to reveal information about the plaintext of encrypted traffic.

These are just a few examples of SSL/TLS vulnerabilities that were known at the time of my last update. The security landscape evolves, and new vulnerabilities may have been discovered since then. It's crucial to stay updated with the latest security advisories and best practices to ensure the security of your systems.
