FREAK, which stands for "Factoring Attack on RSA-EXPORT Keys," is a cryptographic vulnerability that affects the security of SSL/TLS protocols. It was discovered in 2015 and involves a weakness in the way certain servers handle encryption keys.

The FREAK attack targets the use of weak "export-grade" encryption, which was a practice in the 1990s due to U.S. government restrictions on strong encryption exports. These weak encryption keys could be factored relatively easily, making the encryption less secure. Although modern systems do not typically use these weak encryption keys, some servers and clients retained support for them, which allowed attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

Here's how the FREAK attack works:

1. The attacker intercepts the initial handshake between a client and a server that supports export-grade encryption.
2. The attacker forces the connection to use the weak export-grade cipher suites by manipulating the communication or posing as a compromised server.
3. The attacker then performs a mathematical factorization of the weak encryption key, which was relatively simple due to its export-grade nature.
4. With the factorized key, the attacker can decrypt the encrypted traffic exchanged between the client and server.
To mitigate the FREAK attack, it's important to take the following steps:

1. **Disable Export-Grade Cipher Suites**: Ensure that your server and client configurations do not support export-grade cipher suites. This prevents attackers from forcing the use of weak encryption keys.
2. **Update Software**: Keep your server and client software up to date to ensure that known vulnerabilities are patched.
3. **Use Strong Encryption**: Always use strong encryption algorithms and keys to enhance security.

It's worth noting that the FREAK vulnerability was a result of historical export restrictions on encryption technology. As those restrictions were lifted and stronger encryption became the norm, the practical risk of FREAK attacks diminished. However, it's important to remain vigilant and follow security best practices to ensure that your systems are not vulnerable to known attacks.
