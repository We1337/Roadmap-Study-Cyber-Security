In programming, "signed" and "unsigned" are terms used to describe two different interpretations of integral data types (like `int`, `char`, `short`, `long`, etc.). These interpretations affect how the binary representation of data is interpreted and how operations are performed on it. Here's a breakdown of the differences between signed and unsigned data types:

**Signed Data Types**:
- A signed data type can represent both positive and negative values.
- The most significant bit (MSB) is reserved for the sign bit. It's 0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers.
- The range of values a signed data type can represent is divided between positive and negative values. For example, a signed 8-bit integer (`char`) typically ranges from -128 to 127.

**Unsigned Data Types**:
- An unsigned data type can only represent non-negative values (zero and positive).
- The entire binary representation is used to represent positive values. There's no sign bit.
- The range of values an unsigned data type can represent is from 0 to the maximum positive value. For example, an unsigned 8-bit integer ranges from 0 to 255.

Here are some examples in C++ to illustrate the differences:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Signed integer
    int signedInt = -42;
    std::cout << "Signed integer: " << signedInt << std::endl;

    // Unsigned integer
    unsigned int unsignedInt = 42;
    std::cout << "Unsigned integer: " << unsignedInt << std::endl;

    // Signed char
    char signedChar = -100;
    std::cout << "Signed char: " << static_cast<int>(signedChar) << std::endl;

    // Unsigned char
    unsigned char unsignedChar = 200;
    std::cout << "Unsigned char: " << static_cast<int>(unsignedChar) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

Keep in mind that when performing arithmetic operations between signed and unsigned values, there might be some unexpected results due to the different interpretations of the sign bit. In comparisons between signed and unsigned values, C++ will promote the signed value to an unsigned value if necessary, which can also lead to unexpected behavior.

Choosing between signed and unsigned data types depends on the context and the values you need to work with. In general, use signed types when you need to represent both positive and negative values, and use unsigned types when negative values don't make sense in the context of your program.
