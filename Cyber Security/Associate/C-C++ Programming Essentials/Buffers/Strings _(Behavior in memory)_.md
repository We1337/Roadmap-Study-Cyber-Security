Strings are sequences of characters that represent textual data in programming. In most programming languages, strings are considered a fundamental data type and are used to store and manipulate text-based information. The behavior of strings in memory varies depending on the programming language and the data structures used to represent them.

Here's an overview of how strings are typically handled in memory:

1. **Character Encoding**:
   - Strings are composed of individual characters. Each character is typically represented using a specific encoding, such as ASCII, UTF-8, or UTF-16, which assigns numerical values (code points) to characters.
   - The choice of encoding affects the range of characters that can be represented and the memory required for each character.

2. **String as an Array of Characters**:
   - In many programming languages, strings are internally represented as arrays of characters.
   - Each character occupies a fixed amount of memory, usually one or more bytes.

3. **Null-Terminated Strings (C-Style Strings)**:
   - In languages like C and C++, strings are often represented as arrays of characters terminated by a null character (`'\0'`).
   - For example, the string `"hello"` is represented as `'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'`.

4. **String Objects and Dynamic Memory Allocation**:
   - Some programming languages (like C++, Java, Python) provide string objects that encapsulate strings and offer various methods for string manipulation.
   - In these languages, strings can be dynamically allocated and resized.

5. **Immutable Strings**:
   - In many programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning that their content cannot be changed after creation.
   - When you modify a string, a new string is often created in memory.

6. **String Interning**:
   - Some languages (e.g., Python) use a technique called "string interning" to optimize memory usage for strings. Identical strings are stored in memory only once, and variables are assigned references to the same memory location.

7. **String Concatenation**:
   - Concatenating strings can involve creating new memory for the combined string. Some languages provide more efficient ways to concatenate strings (e.g., using `StringBuilder` in Java or `std::string` in C++).

8. **Garbage Collection and Memory Management**:
   - In languages with automatic memory management (like Java, Python), strings are managed by the memory management system, which may involve garbage collection.

9. **Unicode Support**:
   - Many programming languages provide support for Unicode, allowing strings to represent characters from a wide range of languages and symbols.

Remember that the behavior of strings can vary based on the programming language and the libraries or frameworks being used. Always consult the documentation of the specific language you're working with to understand how strings are represented and manipulated in that context.
