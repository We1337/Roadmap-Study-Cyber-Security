Polymorphism is a core concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent multiple implementations, providing flexibility and interchangeability in the code. Polymorphism is closely tied to inheritance and dynamic binding (also known as late binding or runtime binding).

There are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time (static) polymorphism and runtime (dynamic) polymorphism.

1. **Compile-Time (Static) Polymorphism**:
   - Also known as "early binding."
   - Achieved through function overloading and operator overloading.
   - Function overloading: Defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists.
   - Operator overloading: Defining custom behaviors for operators when applied to objects of a class.

Example of compile-time polymorphism using function overloading:

```cpp
class Math {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};

int main() {
    Math math;
    std::cout << math.add(2, 3) << std::endl;        // Uses int version
    std::cout << math.add(2.5, 3.5) << std::endl;    // Uses double version

    return 0;
}
```

2. **Runtime (Dynamic) Polymorphism**:
   - Also known as "late binding."
   - Achieved through inheritance and virtual functions (methods).
   - Virtual functions are declared in the base class and overridden in derived classes.
   - The appropriate function is called at runtime based on the actual type of the object.

Example of runtime polymorphism using virtual functions:

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    double area() const override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};

int main() {
    Circle circle(5.0);
    Shape* shape = &circle; // Pointer to base class

    std::cout << "Area: " << shape->area() << std::endl; // Calls Circle's area()

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the `Shape` class has a pure virtual method `area()`, and the `Circle` class overrides this method. Even though the pointer `shape` is of type `Shape*`, at runtime, it invokes the correct `area()` method of the actual object, demonstrating dynamic polymorphism.

Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, allowing you to design systems that can handle various implementations without knowing their exact types. It promotes extensibility, code reusability, and cleaner interfaces in complex software architectures.
