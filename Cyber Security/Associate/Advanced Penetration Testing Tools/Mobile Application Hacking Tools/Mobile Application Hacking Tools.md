Here are some tools that security researchers often use for mobile application security assessments:

1. **Frida:** As mentioned before, Frida is a dynamic instrumentation toolkit that can be used to analyze the runtime behavior of mobile applications. It's often used for security research and debugging purposes.
2. **Mobile Security Framework (MobSF):** MobSF is an open-source mobile app security testing framework that provides automated static and dynamic analysis of Android and iOS applications.
3. **Burp Suite:** Burp Suite is a popular tool for web application security testing, but it also has extensions and features for testing the security of mobile applications by intercepting and analyzing network traffic.
4. **OWASP ZAP:** Similar to Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP is another web application security tool that can be used to analyze mobile app communication by acting as a proxy.
5. **Drozer (MWR Labs Framework):** Drozer is an Android security assessment framework that helps security professionals identify vulnerabilities and security issues in Android applications.
6. **QARK (Quick Android Review Kit):** QARK is a tool designed to automate the process of identifying security issues in Android applications.
7. **AndroBugs:** AndroBugs is an open-source tool that performs static code analysis on Android applications to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
8. **APKTool:** APKTool is used for reverse engineering Android APK files to obtain the application's source code and resources.

Remember that these tools are meant for ethical security research and assessment purposes. Always obtain proper authorization before testing any application. Unauthorized testing is unethical and potentially illegal. Additionally, responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you discover is important to ensure that developers have an opportunity to fix them.
