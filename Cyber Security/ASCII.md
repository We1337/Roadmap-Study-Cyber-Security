ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a standard character encoding scheme that was developed in the 1960s by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) to represent text and control characters in electronic devices and communication systems. ASCII uses a 7-bit code to represent a total of 128 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, punctuation marks, and control characters such as newline, carriage return, and tab.

ASCII is widely used in computer systems and communication protocols to represent text-based information, and it forms the basis for many other character encoding schemes, such as UTF-8, which is a widely used encoding for representing text in modern computing systems.

ASCII characters are represented using their corresponding binary values, ranging from 0 to 127. For example, the ASCII value for uppercase letter 'A' is 65, and the ASCII value for lowercase letter 'a' is 97. ASCII values can be used to represent characters in programming languages, file formats, and other contexts where text needs to be represented in a machine-readable format. ASCII has been an important standard for text encoding in the early days of computing and remains relevant today in many applications.
