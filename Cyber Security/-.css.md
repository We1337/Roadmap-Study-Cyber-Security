.CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files are used to define the appearance and layout of web pages. CSS is a styling language that works in conjunction with HTML files to separate the presentation (i.e., the styling) from the structure and content (i.e., the markup) of a web page. CSS files contain style rules that specify how HTML elements should be displayed, such as their colors, fonts, sizes, positions, and other visual properties.

CSS files typically have a `.css` file extension and consist of plain text with CSS rules. CSS rules are made up of selectors and declarations. Selectors target HTML elements, and declarations define the style properties and values for those elements. Here's an example of a simple CSS file:

```css
/* Style for paragraphs */
p {
    color: #333;
    font-size: 16px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

/* Style for headings */
h1, h2, h3 {
    color: #666;
    font-family: "Helvetica", sans-serif;
    margin-top: 20px;
    margin-bottom: 10px;
}

/* Style for links */
a {
    color: #007bff;
    text-decoration: none;
}

/* Style for hover effect on links */
a:hover {
    color: #0056b3;
    text-decoration: underline;
}
```

In this example, the CSS file contains three sets of style rules. The first set of rules targets `<p>` elements and defines their color, font size, and margin properties. The second set of rules targets `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` elements and defines their color, font family, and margin properties. The third set of rules targets `<a>` (anchor) elements and defines their color and text decoration properties, with a special hover effect for when the mouse pointer is over the links.

CSS files are referenced in HTML files using `<link>` tags in the `<head>` section of the HTML document. For example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    <a href="#">Click me</a>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the HTML file includes a `<link>` tag that references a `styles.css` file, which contains the CSS rules for styling the web page. The CSS rules defined in the CSS file will be applied to the corresponding HTML elements, allowing developers to control the appearance and layout of web pages using separate CSS files, which can be easily maintained and updated independently from the HTML content.
