There are various file extensions used for code files, depending on the programming language and the purpose of the file. Some common code file extensions include:

1. .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp: These extensions are used for C and C++ programming language files, including C source code, C++ source code, and header files.
2. .java: This extension is used for Java programming language files, including Java source code files.
3. .py: This extension is used for Python programming language files, including Python source code files.
4. .js: This extension is used for JavaScript programming language files, including JavaScript source code files used for web development.
5. .html, .css: These extensions are used for web development files. .html is used for HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) files, which define the structure and content of web pages, while .css is used for CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) files, which define the styling and layout of web pages.
6. .php: This extension is used for PHP programming language files, which are commonly used for server-side web development.
7. .rb: This extension is used for Ruby programming language files, including Ruby source code files.
8. .swift: This extension is used for Swift programming language files, which are used for developing applications for Apple platforms such as iOS, macOS, and watchOS.
9. .sql: This extension is used for SQL (Structured Query Language) files, which are used for defining and managing relational databases.
10. .sh: This extension is used for shell script files, which contain commands to be executed in a Unix or Linux shell environment.

These are just a few examples of common code file extensions. There are many other file extensions used for different programming languages and purposes. Code files typically contain human-readable text that is written in a specific programming language and can be opened, edited, and executed using appropriate software tools and development environments.
