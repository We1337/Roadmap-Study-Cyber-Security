An HTML file, identified by the extension ".html" (or sometimes ".htm"), is the foundation of a web page. It's like the blueprint that tells a web browser how to structure and display the content you see on a website. Here's a closer look at what an HTML file is and how it works:

**Functionality:**

- **Defines the structure:** HTML uses **tags** to define different sections of a web page, such as the head, body, headings, paragraphs, lists, and more. These tags act like instructions for the browser, telling it how to organize and display the content.
- **Contains content:** While HTML primarily focuses on structure, it can also directly include text, images, and links. It can also reference other files like CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.

**Example of an HTML file:**

HTML

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>My Website</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple example of an HTML page.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
  <a href="https://www.example.com">Click here for more information.</a>
</body>
</html>
```

**Explanation of the example:**

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This line declares the document type as HTML.
- `<html>` and `</html>`: These tags define the root element of the HTML document.
- `<head>` and `</head>`: This section contains information not displayed on the page, such as the title and character encoding.
- `<body>` and `</body>`: This section contains the content that will be displayed on the web page.
- `<h1>` and `</h1>`: These tags define a heading element with the text "Welcome to my website!".
- `<p>` and `</p>`: These tags define a paragraph element with the text "This is a simple example of an HTML page.".
- `<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">`: This tag inserts an image with the source "image.jpg" and an alternative description for accessibility.
- `<a href="https://www.example.com">Click here for more information.</a>`: This tag creates a hyperlink with the text "Click here for more information" that links to the URL "[https://www.example.com](https://www.example.com/)".

**Additional points:**

- HTML is a relatively simple language, making it a good starting point for learning web development.
- While HTML focuses on content and structure, CSS is typically used to control the visual appearance of the page (colors, fonts, layout).
- JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, allowing for actions like form submissions, animations, and more.
