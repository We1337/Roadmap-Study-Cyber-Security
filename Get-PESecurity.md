It seems like you're referring to a PowerShell module or script called "Get-PESecurity." However, as of my last knowledge update in September 2021, I'm not aware of any specific PowerShell module or script with that name. It's possible that this module or script has been developed or released after my last update.

If "Get-PESecurity" is indeed a tool or module related to Portable Executable (PE) file security analysis, reverse engineering, or any other task, I recommend doing the following:

1. **Search Online**: Conduct a search on popular code repositories like GitHub or other platforms where developers share their projects. Use search terms like "Get-PESecurity PowerShell" or "PE file security analysis PowerShell" to find relevant tools.
2. **Check Documentation**: If you have any documentation or context about the "Get-PESecurity" tool, review it to understand its features, usage, and purpose.
3. **Community Forums**: Visit forums related to reverse engineering, malware analysis, and PowerShell scripting. Other professionals in these fields might be aware of the tool and could provide information or guidance.
4. **Security Research Communities**: Online communities and forums dedicated to security research and reverse engineering might have discussions or announcements related to new tools.
5. **Updates**: Keep an eye on updates to relevant tools, as developers often release new versions and modules with improved functionality.
6. **Code Repositories**: If you're looking for PowerShell modules, scripts, or tools related to PE security, explore GitHub repositories and similar platforms where developers share their work.

Remember that when using third-party tools for security analysis or reverse engineering, it's important to verify the authenticity of the tool, understand its functionality, and ensure that you have the necessary permissions to use it for your intended purpose. Additionally, always exercise caution and follow ethical guidelines when analyzing software, especially if it involves potentially malicious files or activities.
