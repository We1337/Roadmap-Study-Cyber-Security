In addition to the previously mentioned attack vectors, there are also specific vulnerabilities that can be associated with certain web application features, such as forms and file uploads. Here are some examples:

1. Form Injection: Form injection attacks occur when an attacker submits malicious data into a form on a website or application, which can then be executed on the server-side to compromise the system.
2. File Upload Vulnerabilities: File upload vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can upload a malicious file onto a server or website, which can then be executed by the server or other users.
3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF attacks are aimed at tricking a user into performing an unintended action on a website or application, such as making a fraudulent purchase or changing a password.
4. Clickjacking: Clickjacking is a type of attack that tricks a user into clicking on a disguised link or button, which can lead to unintended actions or information disclosure. 
5. XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks: XXE attacks are a type of injection attack that target vulnerabilities in XML parsers, which can allow attackers to read or modify sensitive data on a server or application. 

It's important for web developers to understand these vulnerabilities and implement appropriate security measures, such as input validation and file type restrictions, to protect against these types of attacks.
