# Cybersecurity Roadmap

This document outlines our organization's strategy for managing and improving our cybersecurity posture over time. Our goal is to reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect our sensitive information and assets.

### Risk Assessment

The first step in our cybersecurity roadmap is to conduct a thorough risk assessment. This will involve identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and processes, and prioritizing them based on their likelihood and potential impact.

### How to use

To open a vault in Obsidian, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Obsidian on your computer.
2. Click on the "Open another vault" button in the lower-left corner of the screen, or go to "File" > "Open another vault" in the menu bar.
3. Select the folder that contains your vault, or select the ".obsidian" folder within your vault.
4. Click "Open" to open the vault in Obsidian.

Once your vault is open, you can start creating and editing notes, linking them together, and organizing them using hashtags and other features.

### Goals and Objectives

Based on our risk assessment, we will establish goals and objectives for improving our security posture. These might include:

    Implementing multi-factor authentication for all users
    Regularly updating and patching our systems and software
    Conducting regular employee security awareness training
    Implementing a secure coding framework for our developers
    Implementing a security incident response plan

### Timeline

We will establish a timeline for achieving our goals and objectives, prioritizing initiatives based on their importance and the resources required to implement them. We will regularly review our progress and adjust our roadmap as necessary.

### Budget and Resources

We will allocate resources and budget to support our security initiatives, including hiring additional staff, investing in new technologies or tools, or outsourcing certain security functions to third-party providers.

### Metrics and Monitoring

To track our progress and ensure that our security initiatives are effective, we will establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and a monitoring plan. This may involve regular vulnerability scans, security assessments, or incident response simulations.

### Conclusion

Our cybersecurity roadmap is a living document that will evolve over time as our organization's needs and risks change. By following this roadmap, we aim to improve our security posture and reduce the risk of cyber attacks.
