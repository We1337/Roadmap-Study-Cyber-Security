An **out-of-the-box router**, also known as a new or unconfigured router, refers to a networking device that has not been set up or customized for use. It typically comes with default settings that may not be optimal for your specific needs, and you'll need to configure it before you can connect your devices to the internet.

Here are some of the things you'll typically need to do when setting up a new router:

1. **Connect the router to your modem.** This is usually done using an Ethernet cable.
2. **Power on the router and modem.**
3. **Access the router's web interface.** You can usually do this by opening a web browser and typing the router's IP address into the address bar. The IP address is typically printed on a label on the bottom of the router.
4. **Log in to the router's web interface.** You'll need to enter the router's username and password. These are also typically printed on a label on the bottom of the router.
5. **Change the default settings.** This includes things like the SSID (the name of your Wi-Fi network), the Wi-Fi password, and the security settings.
6. **Save your changes and reboot the router.**

Once you've completed these steps, you should be able to connect your devices to the internet using the Wi-Fi network name and password that you created.

It's important to note that the specific steps for setting up a router will vary depending on the make and model of the router. If you're having trouble setting up your router, you can consult the router's manual or contact the manufacturer for support.
