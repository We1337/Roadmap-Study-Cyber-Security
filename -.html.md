Web files are the building blocks of websites. They work together to present information and functionality to users in a web browser. Here are the main types of web files:

**1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) Files:**

- **Function:** These files define the structure and content of a web page, including headings, paragraphs, images, links, and other elements.
- **Extension:** .html or .htm
    
- **Example:** The code for this very page you're reading is written in HTML.

**2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) Files:**

- **Function:** These files control the visual appearance of a web page, such as fonts, colors, layout, and spacing.
- **Extension:** .css
    
- **Example:** The CSS file determines the font size, color scheme, and layout of this page.

**3. JavaScript Files:**

- **Function:** These files add interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. They can be used to create animations, handle form submissions, and more.
- **Extension:** .js
    
- **Example:** JavaScript might be used to create a pop-up form when you click a button on a web page.

**4. Image Files:**

- **Function:** These files display images on web pages.
- **Extensions:** Common image file extensions include .jpg, .png, .gif, and .svg.

**6. Other Files:**

- **Function:** In addition to the above, several other file types can be used on web pages, such as:
    - **Font files (.ttf, .woff):** Define the fonts used on the webpage.
    - **PDF files (.pdf):** Embed portable document formats for users to download.
    - **Icon files (.ico, .favico):** Define the small icon displayed in the browser tab and bookmark list.
