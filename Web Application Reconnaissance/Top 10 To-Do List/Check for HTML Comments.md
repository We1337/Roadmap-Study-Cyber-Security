To check for HTML comments in a webpage, you can examine the page's HTML source code. HTML comments are snippets of text within `<!--` and `-->` tags that are not rendered by the browser but can provide valuable information about the code or page content. Here's how you can search for HTML comments:

1. **View page source**: Right-click on the webpage you want to inspect and select "View Page Source" or a similar option in your web browser. This will display the HTML source code of the page.
2. **Search for comment tags**: Use your browser's search function (usually accessible by pressing Ctrl+F or Command+F) to open the search box. Enter `<!--` as the search term and look for matches within the HTML source.
3. **Inspect the comments**: Scan through the HTML source code and examine the content between `<!--` and `-->` tags. HTML comments may contain various types of information, such as:
    -   Notes or explanations about the code structure or functionality.
    -   Development or debugging information.
    -   Hidden content or sensitive information accidentally left in comments.
    Pay attention to any comments that appear to contain sensitive data, credentials, or hints about potential vulnerabilities.    
4. **Repeat the process**: If you don't find any comments or want to ensure thorough analysis, search for additional comment tags throughout the HTML source code. Some comments may be nested or span multiple lines, so be diligent in your search.

Remember that HTML comments are typically intended for developers and are not meant to expose sensitive information. However, it's important to review them as part of a security assessment to ensure that no unintended data or vulnerabilities are disclosed.

Additionally, please note that while HTML comments can provide insights into the code, they are not the only place where sensitive information might be found. It's important to conduct a comprehensive review of the entire application, including other files, configuration files, server responses, and database queries, to identify any potential security issues or data leakage.
