To check security headers on a website, you can use a variety of online tools that analyze HTTP response headers. Here are a few popular options:

1. SecurityHeaders.com: This website allows you to enter a URL and will provide a report of the security headers present on the page. It will also give suggestions on how to improve the website's security.
2. Mozilla Observatory: This tool will test a website for a wide range of security issues, including security headers. It will provide a report with a letter grade based on the website's security posture.
3. Google Chrome DevTools: If you're using the Google Chrome browser, you can open the DevTools, navigate to the "Network" tab, and reload the page. The response headers will be displayed, and you can look for security headers such as "Strict-Transport-Security" or "Content-Security-Policy."

Remember that having security headers is just one aspect of a secure website. It's important to also have other security measures in place, such as SSL/TLS certificates, firewalls, and strong access controls.
