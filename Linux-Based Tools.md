Certainly, there are several Linux-based tools that are widely used for reverse engineering, analysis, and security research. Here are some notable tools that you might find useful:

1. **Ghidra**: An open-source software reverse engineering framework developed by the National Security Agency (NSA). It supports a wide range of architectures and provides features for analyzing and disassembling binaries.
2. **Radare2**: An open-source framework for reverse engineering that includes a disassembler, debugger, and analysis tools. It's highly scriptable and customizable.
3. **IDA Pro**: Although primarily known as a Windows tool, IDA Pro also offers a Linux version. It's a powerful and versatile disassembler and debugger.
4. **Hopper Disassembler**: A commercial disassembler available for Linux that supports various architectures and provides a user-friendly interface.
5. **Cutter**: An open-source graphical interface for Radare2. Cutter simplifies the use of Radare2 by providing a more intuitive interface for analysis.
6. **Binwalk**: A tool for analyzing and extracting firmware images, as well as identifying embedded file systems and executable code within binary files.
7. **Wireshark**: A popular network protocol analyzer used for analyzing network traffic. It can help identify vulnerabilities and analyze network behavior.
8. **Volatility**: A framework for analyzing memory dumps from Linux systems, used for digital forensics and incident response.
9. **YARA**: A tool for creating and using custom rules to identify and classify malware and other patterns in files.
10. **GDB (GNU Debugger)**: A powerful debugger for analyzing and debugging executable code. It supports various programming languages and can be used for reverse engineering.
11. **Bokken**: A GUI for the Pyew and Radare2 tools, providing a user-friendly interface for analyzing binaries.
12. **EvilGnome**: A Linux-based RAT (Remote Access Trojan) analysis tool that focuses on analyzing and understanding Linux malware.
13. **Angr**: An open-source binary analysis framework that supports symbolic execution and program analysis for vulnerability discovery and exploit generation.
14. **Rizin**: An open-source reverse engineering framework that's similar to Radare2 and offers disassembling, debugging, and analysis capabilities.
15. **Remnux**: A Linux distribution designed for analyzing and reverse engineering malware. It includes a collection of useful tools for these tasks.

These tools cover a range of functionalities, from disassembling and debugging to memory analysis and malware analysis. Keep in mind that each tool has its own learning curve and strengths, so it's a good idea to explore multiple tools to find the ones that best suit your specific needs and preferences.
