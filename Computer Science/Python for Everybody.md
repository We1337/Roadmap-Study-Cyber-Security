**Chapter 1**

Computers want to be helpful...
* Computers are built for one purpose - to do things for us
* But we need to speak their language to describe what we want done
* User have it easy - someone already put many different programs (instructions) into the computer and users just pick the ones they want to use

**Programmes Anticipate Needs**
* iPhone Applications are a market
* iPhone Applications have over 3 Billion downloads
* Programmers have left their jobs to be full-time iPhone developers
* Programmers know the ways of the program

**Users vs. Programmers**
* Users see computers as a set of tools - word processor, spreadsheet, map, to-do list, etc.
* Programmers learn the computer "ways" and the computer language
* Progarmmers have some tools that allow them to build new tools
* Programmers sometimes write tools for lots of users and sometimes programmers write little "helpers" for themselves to automate a task

**Why be a programmer?**
* To get some task done - we are the user and programmer
	* Clean up survey data
* To produce something for others to use - a programming job
	* Fix a performance problem in the Sakai software
	* Add guestbook to a web site

**What is Code? Software? A Program?**
* A sequence of stored instructions
	* It is a little piece of our intelligence in the computer
	* We figure something out and then we encode it and then give it to someoneelse to save them the time and energy of figuring it out 
* A piece of crative art - particularly when we do a good job one user experience
