Data structures refer to the way data is organized, stored, and manipulated in a computer program. A data structure is a way to represent and manage data efficiently in memory.

There are many types of data structures, but some of the most common ones are:

1.  Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations.
    
2.  Linked Lists: A data structure in which elements are stored in nodes that have pointers to the next node in the list.
    
3.  Stacks: A data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element added is the first one to be removed.
    
4.  Queues: A data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added is the first one to be removed.
    
5.  Trees: A data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges, with a single root node at the top.
    
6.  Graphs: A data structure that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges, which can be directed or undirected.
    

Data structures are essential for efficient programming and are used extensively in algorithms, databases, and other areas of computer science. The choice of data structure depends on the problem being solved and the requirements of the application.
