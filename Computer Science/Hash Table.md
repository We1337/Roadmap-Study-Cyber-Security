A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs. It is also known as a hash map or dictionary in some programming languages.

In a hash table, keys are hashed using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where the corresponding value can be found. Ideally, the hash function should distribute the keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions, which occur when two keys hash to the same index.

Here's an example of a hash table implemented in Python using separate chaining for collision resolution:

```Python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self):
        self.size = 10
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]
    
    def hash_function(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.size
    
    def insert(self, key, value):
        hash_value = self.hash_function(key)
        bucket = self.table[hash_value]
        for i, (k, v) in enumerate(bucket):
            if k == key:
                bucket[i] = (key, value)
                return
        bucket.append((key, value))
    
    def search(self, key):
        hash_value = self.hash_function(key)
        bucket = self.table[hash_value]
        for k, v in bucket:
            if k == key:
                return v
        return None
    
    def delete(self, key):
        hash_value = self.hash_function(key)
        bucket = self.table[hash_value]
        for i, (k, v) in enumerate(bucket):
            if k == key:
                del bucket[i]
                return
```

A hash table is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of key-value pairs. It is also known as a hash map or dictionary in some programming languages.

In a hash table, keys are hashed using a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, where the corresponding value can be found. Ideally, the hash function should distribute the keys uniformly across the array to minimize collisions, which occur when two keys hash to the same index.

Here's an example of a hash table implemented in Python using separate chaining for collision resolution:

```Python
# Create a new hash table
my_hash_table = HashTable()

# Insert some key-value pairs into the table
my_hash_table.insert("apple", 1)
my_hash_table.insert("banana", 2)
my_hash_table.insert("cherry", 3)

# Search for a key in the table
print(my_hash_table.search("banana"))  # Output: 2

# Delete a key-value pair from the table
my_hash_table.delete("cherry")

# Search for a deleted key in the table
print(my_hash_table.search("cherry"))  # Output: None
```

In this example, we define a `HashTable` class with four methods: `hash_function`, `insert`, `search`, and `delete`.

The `hash_function` method takes a key as input and returns an index into the table using the built-in `hash` function.

The `insert` method takes a key-value pair as input and inserts it into the hash table. If the key already exists in the table, its value is updated with the new value.

The `search` method takes a key as input and returns the corresponding value from the hash table, or `None` if the key is not found.

The `delete` method takes a key as input and removes the corresponding key-value pair from the hash table.

Here's an example of how to use the hash table class:

```Python
# Create a new hash table
my_hash_table = HashTable()

# Insert some key-value pairs into the table
my_hash_table.insert("apple", 1)
my_hash_table.insert("banana", 2)
my_hash_table.insert("cherry", 3)

# Search for a key in the table
print(my_hash_table.search("banana"))  # Output: 2

# Delete a key-value pair from the table
my_hash_table.delete("cherry")

# Search for a deleted key in the table
print(my_hash_table.search("cherry"))  # Output: None
```

This code creates a new hash table, inserts some key-value pairs into the table using the `insert` method, searches for a key in the table using the `search` method, deletes a key-value pair from the table using the `delete` method, and searches for a deleted key in the table using the `search` method. The output of the program will be:

```
2
None
```
