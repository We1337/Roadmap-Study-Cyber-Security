In the context of web technology, "Secure" typically refers to the use of encryption protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit between a client (such as a web browser) and a server.

When a website is accessed using HTTPS, the communication between the client and the server is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocols, which makes it much harder for unauthorized parties to intercept or tamper with the data being transmitted. This is particularly important for websites that handle sensitive information, such as credit card details or personal identification data.

In addition to the use of encryption, the term "Secure" can also refer to other security measures, such as password protection, access controls, and software patches to address known vulnerabilities. A website or web application that is described as "Secure" generally implies that the site has been designed and maintained with security in mind, and that reasonable measures have been taken to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access or malicious attacks.
