A "Cookie HostOnly" is a type of cookie that is only sent to the server by the web browser if the request is being sent to the same domain or subdomain that set the cookie.

In other words, if a website sets a cookie with the "HostOnly" flag, the cookie will only be sent to that website's server when a request is made to that same website or a subdomain of that website. This means that the cookie cannot be accessed by other websites, even if they are on the same server or domain.

The HostOnly flag is used to improve security and privacy by preventing cookies from being shared between websites, which could be exploited by malicious actors to track users or steal sensitive information.
