GET is an HTTP method used to request a resource from a server. When a client (e.g., a web browser) makes a GET request, it is asking the server to retrieve a specific resource, such as a webpage, image, or video.

GET requests are typically used for retrieving data, rather than modifying or deleting it. Because GET requests only retrieve data and do not change the server's state, they are considered safe and can be cached by intermediaries such as web browsers and proxy servers.

Here is an example of a GET request:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.93 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
```

In this example, the client is making a GET request for the `index.html` file from the `example.com` domain, using the HTTP/1.1 protocol. The `User-Agent` header indicates the web browser being used to make the request, while the `Accept` header specifies the types of content that the client can handle.

The server will respond to the GET request by sending back the requested resource, along with an HTTP response code indicating whether the request was successful.
