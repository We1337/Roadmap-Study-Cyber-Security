jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and AJAX. It provides an easy-to-use API that simplifies common JavaScript tasks and makes it easy to create dynamic and interactive web pages.

Here are some examples of jQuery syntax:

1.  Selecting an element:

```javascript
// select a single element by its ID
var element = $('#my-element');

// select multiple elements by tag name
var elements = $('div');
```

2.  Changing the style of an element:

```javascript
// change the background color of an element
$('#my-element').css('background-color', 'red');

// hide an element
$('#my-element').hide();
```

3.  Handling events:

```javascript
// add a click event handler to an element
$('#my-button').click(function() {
  // handle the click event
});

// trigger a custom event on an element
$('#my-element').trigger('my-event');
```

4.  Making an AJAX request:

```javascript
// make an AJAX request to a server
$.ajax({
  url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
  method: 'GET',
  dataType: 'json',
  success: function(data) {
    // handle the response data
    console.log(data);
  },
  error: function(xhr, status, error) {
    // handle the error
    console.log('Error: ' + error);
  }
});
```

In this example, we use the `$.ajax()` method to make an AJAX request to a server, specifying the URL, HTTP method, data type, and success and error callback functions. The success function is called when the request is successful and receives the response data as a parameter, while the error function is called when the request fails and receives the error message as a parameter.

jQuery is widely used in web development and has many plugins and extensions that can be used to add additional functionality to web applications. However, due to the rise of modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js, jQuery is becoming less popular in modern web development.
