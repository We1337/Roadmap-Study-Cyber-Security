Subresource Integrity (SRI) is a security feature in modern browsers that allows web developers to ensure that the resources their web pages depend on, such as JavaScript files or CSS stylesheets, are not tampered with or corrupted during transit. JavaScript Subresource Integrity (JS SRI) is a specific implementation of SRI that applies to JavaScript resources.

JS SRI works by using a cryptographic hash function to generate a unique hash value for the content of a JavaScript file. This hash value is included in the web page's HTML using the "integrity" attribute on the script tag. When the browser downloads the JavaScript file, it calculates the hash value of the file and compares it to the hash value included in the "integrity" attribute. If the hash values match, the browser knows that the JavaScript file has not been modified during transit and can execute it safely.

Using JS SRI helps protect web applications against malicious attacks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) or code injection attacks, where an attacker injects malicious code into a JavaScript file during transit. By verifying the integrity of the JavaScript file, JS SRI ensures that the code executed by the browser is exactly the code intended by the developer, and not modified by an attacker.

To implement JS SRI, developers can use the "integrity" attribute on the script tag, which includes the hash value of the JavaScript file. For example:

```javascript
<script src="example.js" integrity="sha384-abcdef1234567890"></script>
```

In this example, the "integrity" attribute includes the hash value generated by the cryptographic hash function for the JavaScript file "example.js". The browser uses this hash value to verify the integrity of the file during transit.
