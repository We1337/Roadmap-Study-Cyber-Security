Angular is a popular open-source JavaScript framework for building web applications. It was developed by Google and is based on TypeScript, a statically-typed superset of JavaScript that adds features like type checking and class-based object orientation.

Angular provides a rich set of tools for building web applications, including:

1. Components: Angular applications are built from components, which are reusable building blocks that encapsulate logic and markup. Components can communicate with each other using services and events.
2. Templates: Angular uses HTML templates to define the user interface of an application. Templates can include data bindings, event bindings, and structural directives that modify the DOM based on the state of an application.
3. Services: Angular services are singleton objects that provide functionality to other parts of an application. Services can be used for tasks like data fetching, logging, and authentication.
4. Routing: Angular provides a router module that enables client-side routing, allowing users to navigate between different views in an application without reloading the page. 
5. Forms: Angular includes a forms module that provides tools for building complex, data-driven forms with features like validation and custom form controls.

Angular is widely used in web development and has a large and active community of developers and contributors. However, it has a steeper learning curve than some other frameworks and may require more setup and configuration. Nonetheless, Angular is a powerful and flexible framework that can be used to build a wide range of web applications, from small prototypes to large-scale enterprise applications.
