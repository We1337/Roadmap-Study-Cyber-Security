SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector-based image format that is used to create graphics and illustrations that can be scaled up or down without losing quality. Unlike bitmap image formats like JPEG and PNG, SVG images are not made up of pixels, but instead are made up of mathematical equations that describe the shapes and lines in the image.

SVG images are created using XML markup, which means that they are both human-readable and machine-readable. This makes them easy to edit and customize using text editors or specialized software.

Some of the advantages of using SVG images include:

- Scalability: SVG images can be scaled up or down without losing quality, making them ideal for use in different contexts and on different devices.  
- Small file size: SVG images are often smaller in file size than bitmap image formats, which can make them faster to load and easier to transmit over the internet.  
- Searchability: Because SVG images are made up of text-based code, they can be easily indexed and searched by search engines.  
- Interactivity: SVG images can include interactivity, such as hover effects and animations, which can enhance the user experience.  

Overall, SVG is a powerful and versatile image format that is well-suited to a wide range of applications, including web design, mobile app development, and graphic design.
