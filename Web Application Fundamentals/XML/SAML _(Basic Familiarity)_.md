SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language. It is an XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between different security domains, such as between an identity provider (IdP) and a service provider (SP).

SAML enables single sign-on (SSO), which allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials. When a user logs in to a service provider, the service provider sends a SAML request to the identity provider, asking it to authenticate the user. The identity provider then sends a SAML response back to the service provider, which contains an assertion that the user is authenticated.

The SAML assertion includes information about the user's identity and permissions, which can be used by the service provider to authorize access to specific resources. The assertion is digitally signed to ensure its integrity and authenticity.

SAML has several advantages, including:

- SSO: SAML enables users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of login credentials, which can improve the user experience and reduce the risk of password fatigue.  
- Security: SAML provides a secure way to exchange authentication and authorization data between different security domains, which can help to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data.  
- Standardization: SAML is a widely adopted standard, which means that it is supported by many different applications and systems.  

SAML is used in a variety of contexts, including enterprise and cloud applications, e-commerce, and government systems.
