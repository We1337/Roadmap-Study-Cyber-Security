Content-Type is an HTTP response header that indicates the media type of the response body. The media type is also known as the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) type, which is a standard way of identifying the format of a file or data stream on the Internet.

The Content-Type header is important because it tells the client (such as a web browser) how to handle the response. For example, if the response is a HTML page, the Content-Type should be "text/html". If the response is an image, the Content-Type should be "image/png" or "image/jpeg".

The Content-Type header is typically set by the server, based on the format of the response body. However, in some cases, the client can also set the Content-Type header to indicate the media type of the request body.

The MIME type is a standardized way of identifying the format of a file or data stream. MIME types are used not only for HTTP responses but also in email attachments, file downloads, and other types of data transmission on the Internet. Common MIME types include "text/plain", "text/html", "application/json", "image/png", and "video/mp4".

The use of correct Content-Type headers is important for the proper handling of data and preventing security vulnerabilities such as code injection or buffer overflow attacks. Additionally, proper use of MIME types can help improve performance, by allowing the client to start processing the response before the entire response is received.
