The `X-Csrf-Token` header is a custom HTTP header that can be used to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. CSRF attacks occur when an attacker tricks a user's browser into making an unintended and unauthorized request to a web application, using the user's session credentials.

To prevent CSRF attacks, web applications can use a mechanism known as a CSRF token. A CSRF token is a unique value that is generated by the server and sent to the client as a hidden field or a cookie. When the user submits a form or makes a request, the server checks that the token is present and valid before processing the request. If the token is missing or invalid, the server rejects the request.

The `X-Csrf-Token` header is an alternative way to transmit the CSRF token from the client to the server. When a client makes a request, it includes the CSRF token in the header as a value of the `X-Csrf-Token` header. The server can then verify the token and allow or reject the request accordingly.

Here is an example of an `X-Csrf-Token` header:

```
X-Csrf-Token: 3d971aef-a7b8-4476-a5d1-0d2b9dd84f51
```

This header indicates that the CSRF token for the request is `3d971aef-a7b8-4476-a5d1-0d2b9dd84f51`.

It's important to note that the use of `X-` in a custom HTTP header is a convention, but it is not a requirement. Custom headers can have any name, as long as they are not in conflict with existing headers. Additionally, the use of `X-Csrf-Token` as a header name is not a standardized approach, and there are other ways to transmit CSRF tokens, such as in cookies or hidden form fields.
