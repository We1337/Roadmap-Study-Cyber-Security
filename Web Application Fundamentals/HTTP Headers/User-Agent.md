The User-Agent header is an HTTP request header that provides information about the client making the request, such as the browser type and version, or the name and version of the application.

When a client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request to a server, it includes a User-Agent header to identify itself to the server. The User-Agent string typically contains information such as the client's name, version, operating system, and language settings.

The User-Agent header is useful for web developers and server administrators to understand the characteristics of the client making the request, and to tailor the response accordingly. For example, a server may choose to serve different versions of a web page or application based on the client's User-Agent string.

However, User-Agent strings can also be used for malicious purposes, such as tracking or fingerprinting users across different websites. As a result, some browsers and privacy-focused extensions allow users to customize or spoof their User-Agent strings to protect their privacy and anonymity.
