CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security mechanism implemented in web browsers to restrict web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original web page. This mechanism helps to prevent attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

When a web page attempts to make a cross-origin request, the browser first sends an OPTIONS request to the server to check if the server allows cross-origin requests for the requested resource. The server responds to the OPTIONS request with a set of CORS headers that indicate whether cross-origin requests are allowed and what restrictions apply.

The following are some of the important CORS headers that the server can send in response to an OPTIONS request:

1. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header indicates which domains are allowed to make cross-origin requests to the server. For example, if the server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: [https://example.com](https://example.com), only web pages served from the [https://example.com](https://example.com) domain can make cross-origin requests to the server.
2. Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header indicates which HTTP methods are allowed for cross-origin requests. For example, if the server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, only those HTTP methods can be used for cross-origin requests.
3. Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header indicates which HTTP headers are allowed for cross-origin requests. For example, if the server responds with Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization, only those HTTP headers can be used for cross-origin requests.
4. Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: This header indicates whether the server allows credentials (cookies, HTTP authentication, and client-side SSL certificates) to be sent in cross-origin requests. If the server allows credentials, the web page making the request must set the withCredentials property of the XMLHttpRequest object to true.

The server can also send other CORS headers, such as Access-Control-Max-Age and Access-Control-Expose-Headers, to further configure cross-origin requests.
