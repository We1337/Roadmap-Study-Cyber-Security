Access-Control-Allow-Origin is an HTTP response header that indicates which domains are allowed to make cross-origin requests to the server. This header is used in conjunction with the Origin header sent by the browser as part of the CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) mechanism.

For example, if a web page served from [https://example.com](https://example.com) makes an AJAX request to [https://api.example.com](https://api.example.com), the browser sends the Origin header with the value [https://example.com](https://example.com). The server can then respond with the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header set to [https://example.com](https://example.com), indicating that cross-origin requests from the [https://example.com](https://example.com) domain are allowed.

If the server allows cross-origin requests from any domain, it can set the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to "*", indicating that any domain is allowed to make cross-origin requests.

It is important to note that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header should be set carefully, as allowing cross-origin requests from any domain can pose a security risk. Servers should only allow cross-origin requests from trusted domains and use other security mechanisms such as CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens to ensure that cross-origin requests are made intentionally by the user and not by malicious scripts.
