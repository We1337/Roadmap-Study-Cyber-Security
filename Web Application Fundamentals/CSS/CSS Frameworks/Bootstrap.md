Bootstrap is a popular front-end CSS framework developed by Twitter. It is an open-source toolkit that provides a set of pre-designed CSS classes and JavaScript plugins that can be used to create responsive, mobile-first web pages and applications.

Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-designed UI components, such as navigation menus, forms, buttons, tables, and modals, as well as a flexible grid system that allows developers to easily create responsive layouts. The framework also includes built-in support for popular CSS preprocessors like SASS, as well as JavaScript frameworks like jQuery and Angular.

Some key features of Bootstrap include:

1. Responsive design: Bootstrap's flexible grid system and responsive utilities allow developers to create web pages that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
2. Customizable styling: Bootstrap's extensive collection of pre-designed CSS classes and variables make it easy to customize the look and feel of a website or application.
3. JavaScript plugins: Bootstrap includes a variety of pre-built JavaScript plugins, such as modals, carousels, and dropdowns, that can be easily integrated into a project.
4. Cross-browser compatibility: Bootstrap is designed to work seamlessly across different web browsers and platforms.

Bootstrap is widely used by web developers and designers, and has a large community of contributors and resources, including documentation, tutorials, and third-party plugins. Its popularity is due in part to its ease of use, flexibility, and focus on responsive design, which makes it an ideal choice for developing mobile-first web applications.
