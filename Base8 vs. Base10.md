Base 8, also known as octal, and base 10, also known as decimal, are numeral systems used to represent numbers. Here's a comparison between base 8 and base 10:

Base 8 (Octal):
- Uses eight digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.
- Each digit represents a value that is a power of 8.
- The rightmost digit represents the ones place, the next digit to the left represents the eights place, the next digit represents the sixty-fours place, and so on.
- For example, the octal number 27 is calculated as (2 * 8^1) + (7 * 8^0) = 16 + 7 = 23 in decimal.

Base 10 (Decimal):
- Uses ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
- Each digit represents a value that is a power of 10.
- The rightmost digit represents the ones place, the next digit to the left represents the tens place, the next digit represents the hundreds place, and so on.
- For example, the decimal number 123 is calculated as (1 * 10^2) + (2 * 10^1) + (3 * 10^0) = 100 + 20 + 3 = 123.

Comparison:
- Base 10 is the most common numeral system used by humans and is the standard for everyday arithmetic and mathematics.
- Base 8 is commonly used in computer programming and digital systems, as it represents a convenient way to represent binary numbers. Octal is often used to represent groups of three bits, where each octal digit corresponds to a unique combination of three binary digits (0-7).
- Base 10 provides a wider range of values compared to base 8, as base 8 only has eight unique digits.
- Base 10 is generally more intuitive for most people since we use it in our daily lives, while base 8 requires more mental effort to understand and work with.

In summary, base 8 (octal) uses eight digits and is commonly used in computer programming, while base 10 (decimal) uses ten digits and is the standard for everyday arithmetic and mathematics.
