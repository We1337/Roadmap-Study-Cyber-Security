A CMOS battery, also known as a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor battery or a real-time clock (RTC) battery, is a small, flat battery that powers the CMOS chip on your computer's motherboard. The CMOS chip stores important settings, such as the date and time, system configuration, and boot order, even when the computer is turned off.

Here's a breakdown of what a CMOS battery does and why it's important:

**Functions:**

- **Maintains system settings:** When your computer is turned off, the CMOS battery provides power to the CMOS chip, which keeps important settings like the date and time, system configuration, and boot order in memory.
- **Enables proper startup:** When you turn on your computer, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) uses the settings stored in the CMOS chip to initiate the startup process. Without a functioning CMOS battery, your computer wouldn't know how to start up properly.
- **Keeps time accurate:** The CMOS battery also powers the real-time clock (RTC), which keeps track of the date and time even when the computer is off. This ensures that your computer's clock remains accurate even after power outages or restarts.

**Lifespan:**

- A CMOS battery typically lasts for about 3-5 years, although this can vary depending on the quality of the battery and how often you use your computer.
- When the CMOS battery starts to die, you may notice some signs, such as:
    - Your computer's clock losing time or resetting to the default settings.
    - System configuration settings being lost.
    - Errors during the startup process.

**Replacement:**

- Replacing a CMOS battery is a relatively simple process. You can usually do it yourself with a few basic tools, such as a screwdriver.
- When replacing the battery, make sure to get the correct type for your computer. The most common type of CMOS battery is the CR2032.
- It's important to dispose of old CMOS batteries properly, as they contain hazardous materials.

**In summary, the CMOS battery is a small but important component in your computer. It ensures that your system settings are preserved and that your computer starts up properly. If you notice any signs that your CMOS battery is dying, be sure to replace it as soon as possible.**
