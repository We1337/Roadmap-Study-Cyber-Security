Changing the date and time depends on the device you're using:

**Computer:**

- **Windows:** Go to **Start > Settings > Time & language > Date & time**. Here, you can choose to set the time automatically or manually.
- **Mac:** Click the **Apple menu > System Preferences > Date & Time**. Similar to Windows, you can choose automatic or manual settings.
- **Linux:** The process varies depending on the distribution. Generally, you can use the command line with `date` or `timedatectl` commands, or graphical tools like GNOME Control Center.

**Mobile Device:**

- **Android:** Open the **Settings app > System > Date & time**. You can set automatic or manual settings and choose your time zone.
- **iOS:** Go to **Settings > General > Date & Time**. Adjust the settings as needed, including automatic updates and time zone.

**Other Devices:**

- **Smartwatches:** Look for the settings app or menu on your smartwatch to adjust date and time.
- **Smart TVs:** The process often involves navigating the settings menu and searching for the "Date & Time" option.
- **Embedded Systems:** Refer to the device's manual or manufacturer's instructions for specific steps.

**Additional Notes:**

- When changing the date and time manually, ensure you set them correctly to avoid potential issues with apps, online services, and other time-sensitive functions.
- Automatic settings are generally recommended for convenience and accuracy, as they rely on internet-based time servers.
- Remember that time zone settings might also need adjustment if you're traveling or using the device in a different location.
