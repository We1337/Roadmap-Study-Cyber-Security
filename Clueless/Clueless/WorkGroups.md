A **workgroup** is a **peer-to-peer network** used on **Microsoft Windows** systems that allows **multiple computers to share resources** like files, printers, and internet connection. It's a **simple and easy-to-setup** solution for small networks, typically used in homes or small businesses with a limited number of devices.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Peer-to-peer network:** All computers in a workgroup are considered equal, meaning any computer can act as a client or a server at the same time.
- **Shared resources:** Users can access files, printers, and other resources located on other computers in the workgroup, facilitating collaboration and information sharing.
- **Limited security:** Workgroups offer **basic password protection** for user accounts, but lack the centralized security features and management options found in Active Directory domains (used in larger organizations).
- **Easy setup:** Setting up a workgroup is relatively simple and can be done through the built-in Windows networking tools.

**Benefits of using workgroups:**

- **Cost-effective:** Setting up and maintaining a workgroup is **free and requires minimal technical expertise**.
- **Easy setup:** Ideal for small networks where simple resource sharing is the primary need.
- **Flexibility:** Each computer has a certain degree of independence and can be configured individually.

**Limitations of workgroups:**

- **Limited scalability:** As the number of computers in the network grows, managing user accounts and permissions can become complex in workgroups.
- **Limited security:** Workgroups lack centralized security features like group policies and domain controllers, making them potentially less secure for large deployments.
- **No central management:** There's no central authority for managing user accounts, permissions, and group policies, which can lead to inconsistencies and challenges in maintaining a consistent environment.

**Here's a quick comparison between workgroups and domains:**

|Feature|Workgroup|Domain|
|---|---|---|
|Network type|Peer-to-peer|Client-server|
|Scalability|Limited|High|
|Security|Basic|Centralized and more robust|
|Management|Decentralized|Centralized through domain controller|
|Cost|Free|Requires additional infrastructure and licensing|

**Overall, workgroups are a good option for small networks where ease of setup and basic resource sharing are the primary needs. However, for larger networks or those requiring centralized security and management, domains are the preferred choice.**
