In the context of web development, "pages" can have different meanings depending on the specific technology or framework being used. Here are two common interpretations:

**1. Web Pages:**

- In general web development, a **web page** refers to a **single document** that is accessed and displayed by a web browser. It typically consists of **HTML code**, which defines the structure and content of the page, along with other resources like **CSS** for styling and **JavaScript** for interactivity.
- Each web page has a **unique URL** that users can use to access it.
- A website is essentially a collection of interconnected web pages that are accessible through a common domain name.

**2. WordPress Pages:**

- In the context of the **WordPress CMS**, "pages" refer to a specific **content type** distinct from "posts."
- **Pages** are typically used for **static content** that remains relatively unchanged over time, such as:
    - About Us page
    - Contact Us page
    - Services page
    - Portfolio page
- **Posts**, on the other hand, are used for **dynamic content** that is frequently updated, such as blog entries, news articles, or product updates.
- Both pages and posts can have titles, content, featured images, and other attributes, but they are managed and displayed differently within the WordPress interface.

Therefore, understanding the context is crucial when referring to "pages." In general web development, it usually refers to individual web documents, while in WordPress, it refers to a specific content type for static website content.
