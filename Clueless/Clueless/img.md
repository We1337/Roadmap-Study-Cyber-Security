The `<img>` tag in HTML is used to **embed an image** in a web page. It acts like a placeholder, **referencing the image source** rather than containing the image data itself.

Here's a breakdown of the key points about the `<img>` tag:

**Purpose:**

- Embed images into your web page for visual content and design.

**Structure:**

- While technically an **empty element**, meaning it doesn't have closing tags like `<p>` or `<h1>`, it requires **attributes** to function properly.
- The most important attributes are:
    - `src`: **Required attribute** specifying the **path (URL)** to the image file. This can be a relative path within your website or an absolute URL linking to an external source.
    - `alt`: **Required attribute** providing **alternative text** for the image. This text is displayed if the image cannot be loaded (due to network issues, broken links, or user settings) and is crucial for accessibility, allowing screen readers to convey the image's meaning to users who cannot see it.

**Behavior:**

- The browser fetches the image from the specified source and displays it within the `<img>` tag's location on the page.
- You can use **CSS** to style the image further, controlling aspects like dimensions, positioning, and more.

**Example:**

HTML

```
<img src="images/logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
```

This code embeds an image named "logo.png" from the "images" folder on the same website. The `alt` text describes the image as "Company Logo," which is helpful for accessibility and search engine optimization (SEO).

**Additional points:**

- While not required, you can also specify the image's width and height using the `width` and `height` attributes. This can help prevent layout shifting while the image loads and improve the user experience.
- There are other attributes available for the `<img>` tag, but `src` and `alt` are the most essential for proper functionality and accessibility.
