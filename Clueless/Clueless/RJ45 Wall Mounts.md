As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, "RJ45 wall mounts" is not a standard term in networking hardware. However, I'll provide information on what could be relevant based on the possible interpretations of the term:

1. **Surface Mount Boxes:**
   - Surface mount boxes are sometimes referred to as wall mounts. These boxes are used to house keystone jacks (RJ45 jacks) and provide a clean, organized solution for terminating Ethernet cables on the wall. They often include multiple ports and are mounted directly onto the surface of the wall.

2. **Ethernet Wall Plates:**
   - Wall plates with integrated RJ45 ports are also considered a type of wall mount. These plates typically have one or more RJ45 ports for connecting Ethernet cables. Keystone jacks or modular inserts are often used in conjunction with these plates.

3. **Ethernet Jack Wall Mounts:**
   - Some wall-mounted devices, such as small network switches or network access points, may have built-in RJ45 jacks. These could be considered RJ45 wall mounts as they provide a network connection point directly on the wall.

4. **Wall-Mounted Patch Panels:**
   - In some installations, a wall-mounted patch panel with RJ45 ports may be used. This provides a centralized location for terminating and organizing multiple network cables.

When dealing with networking installations, you may want to clarify whether you are looking for a specific type of wall-mounted networking hardware, such as a surface mount box, wall plate, jack, or patch panel. Additionally, product availability and terminology may have evolved, so it's always a good idea to check the latest products and terminology in the field of networking hardware.
