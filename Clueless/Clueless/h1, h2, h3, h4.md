The `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags in HTML are all used for **headings**, but they represent **different levels of importance** within the document structure. They are often referred to as **heading elements**.

Here's a breakdown of their key characteristics and how they differ:

**Purpose:**

- **Structure and organize** the content of your web page.
- **Improve readability** by visually separating sections and highlighting key points.
- **Convey the hierarchy** and importance of different sections to assistive technologies like screen readers.

**Levels:**

- `<h1>`: **Most important heading**, typically used for the **main title** of the page. There should only be **one `<h1>` element** per page.
- `<h2>`: **Subheadings** that break down the main content into **sections**.
- `<h3>` to `<h6>`: **Further subheadings** for finer content structure. Use these progressively for lower-level sections within your page.

**Default Styles:**

- Browsers typically apply **default styles** to these tags, making them larger and bolder than regular text, with some spacing around them. However, you can **customize the appearance using CSS**.

**Example:**

HTML

```
<h1>Welcome to My Website!</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>This is a paragraph about myself.</p>
<h2>My Projects</h2>
<h3>Project 1</h3>
<p>Description of Project 1.</p>
<h3>Project 2</h3>
<p>Description of Project 2.</p>
```

In this example:

- `<h1>` is used for the main title of the page.
- `<h2>` is used for the two main sections, "About Me" and "My Projects."
- `<h3>` is used for subheadings within the "My Projects" section.

**Additional points:**

- **Do not skip heading levels:** It's essential to use these tags in a **sequential order**, starting with `<h1>` and progressing to lower levels (`<h2>`, `<h3>`, etc.) as needed. This helps maintain a clear and logical structure for both users and search engines.
- **Focus on meaning, not size:** While these tags have default styles affecting size and boldness, **prioritize using them for their semantic meaning** of conveying content organization and hierarchy. Don't use them solely to make text bigger or bolder.

By using these heading tags effectively, you can create a well-structured and organized web page that is easier for users and search engines to understand.
