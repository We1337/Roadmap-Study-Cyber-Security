The "p tag" you're referring to is the **HTML paragraph tag**, written as `<p>`. It's used to define and structure paragraphs of text in a web page.

Here are some key things to know about the `<p>` tag:

- **Purpose:** It creates a visual separation between paragraphs, typically adding a blank line before and after the content.
- **Content:** Anything within the opening `<p>` and closing `</p>` tags will be considered part of the paragraph. This can include text, images, or even other block-level elements like headings.
- **Behavior:** The `<p>` tag is a **block-level element**, meaning it starts on a new line and takes up the full width available. Other block-level elements, like headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), will also start on new lines, creating natural separation between paragraphs and other sections.
- **Styling:** While browsers automatically add some spacing, you can further style paragraphs using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This allows you to control aspects like font size, color, margins, and alignment.

Here's an example of how the `<p>` tag is used:

HTML

```
<p>This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p>This is the second paragraph, containing additional information.</p>
```

This code will render two distinct paragraphs on the web page.
