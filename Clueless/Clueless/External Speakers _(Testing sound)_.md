I cannot directly generate sound or control external devices like speakers. However, I can help you with testing your external speakers using the following methods:

**On Windows:**

1. **Right-click** on the **speaker icon** in the taskbar notification area.
2. Select **Open sound settings**.
3. Click on **Sound control panel**.
4. Under the **Playback** tab, right-click on your **speakers** and select **Test**. You should hear a test sound playing through your speakers.
5. You can also adjust the volume balance and other settings in this window.

**On macOS:**

1. Click on the **Apple icon** in the top left corner of your screen.
2. Select **System Preferences**.
3. Click on **Sound**.
4. Select the **Output** tab.
5. Click on the **test sound** button. You should hear a test sound playing through your speakers.
6. You can also adjust the volume and other settings in this window.

**Additional tips:**

- Make sure your speakers are properly connected to your computer's audio output jack and powered on.
- Check the volume control on your speakers themselves, as they might have a separate volume knob.
- Try playing audio from a different source, such as a music player or video player, to confirm if the issue is specific to your testing method.
- If you're still having trouble, consult your speaker's user manual or the troubleshooting guide for your operating system.
