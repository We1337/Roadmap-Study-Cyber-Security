The syntax of PHP is similar to other programming languages like C and Java, but with some key differences specific to web development and server-side scripting. Here's an overview of some essential elements:

**1. Basic Structure:**

- **PHP code** is embedded within **HTML** using the following tags:
    - `<?php` - Opening tag to mark the beginning of a PHP code block.
    - `?>` - Closing tag to mark the end of a PHP code block.
- **Alternatively**, entire PHP files can use the `.php` extension, where the entire content is considered PHP code.

**2. Variables:**

- Declared using a `$` symbol followed by the variable name.
- Can store different data types like integers, strings, booleans, and arrays.
- Example: `$name = "John Doe";`

**3. Data Types:**

- **Integers:** Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-5`).
- **Strings:** Text enclosed in single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes (e.g., "Hello, world!").
- **Booleans:** Represent true or false values (`true`, `false`).
- **Arrays:** Ordered collections of data (e.g., `$fruits = array("apple", "banana", "orange");`).

**4. Operators:**

- Perform calculations and comparisons like:
    - Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%` (modulo).
    - Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`.
    - Logical operators: `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), `!` (NOT).

**5. Control Flow Statements:**

- Control the execution flow of the code:
    - `if` statements: Execute code conditionally based on a boolean expression.
    - `else` statements: Provide alternative code if the `if` condition is false.
    - `for` loops: Repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
    - `while` loops: Repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true.

**6. Functions:**

- Reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks.
- Defined using the `function` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, and the code block.
- Example:

PHP

```php
function greet($name) {
  echo "Hello, $name!";
}

greet("John Doe"); // Output: Hello, John Doe!
```

**7. Comments:**

- Used to explain the code and improve readability.
- Single-line comments start with `//`.
- Multi-line comments use `/*` and `*/`.

**8. Superglobals:**

- Predefined variables available throughout the script:
    - `$_GET`: Contains data submitted through a URL query string.
    - `$_POST`: Contains data submitted through an HTML form using the POST method.
    - `$_SERVER`: Contains information about the server environment.

**9. Connecting to Databases:**

- PHP can interact with databases using extensions like MySQLi or PDO.
- Allows you to retrieve, manipulate, and store data in a database.
