The basic **syntax** of CSS follows a **rule-based approach**, consisting of three main components:

1. **Selectors:** These identify the specific **HTML elements** you want to style.
2. **Property:** This defines the **aspect** of the element you want to style, like `color`, `font-size`, or `margin`.
3. **Value:** This specifies the **desired outcome** for the chosen property, such as `red`, `16px`, or `10px`.

These components are combined to form **declarations**, which are then grouped within **blocks** surrounded by curly braces (`{}`).

Here's a breakdown of the syntax:

**1. Selectors:**

- There are various types of selectors, including:
    - **Element selectors:** Target specific HTML elements like `<h1>`, `<p>`, or `<div>`.
    - **Class selectors:** Target elements with a specific class assigned using a dot (`.`) followed by the class name. (e.g., `.main-content`)
    - **ID selectors:** Target elements with a unique ID using a hash symbol (`#`) followed by the ID name. (e.g., `#navigation`)
    - **Combinators:** Combine selectors to target elements based on relationships (e.g., child elements, descendant elements) using symbols like `>`, `+`, and `~`.
- You can also use **pseudo-classes** and **pseudo-elements** for more specific targeting.

**2. Properties:**

- These define the **specific characteristic** you want to change, like `color`, `font-size`, `background-color`, `margin`, `padding`, and many more.
- Each property has a specific set of **valid values** it can accept.

**3. Values:**

- These assign the **desired outcome** for the chosen property.
- Values can be:
    - **Keywords:** Predefined options like `red`, `bold`, or `center`.
    - **Numbers:** Often used with units like `px` (pixels), `em` (relative to font size), or `%` (percentage).
    - **Colors:** Represented in various formats like hex codes (`#ff0000`), RGB values (`rgb(255, 0, 0)`), or HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness).
    - **URLs:** Used for referencing external resources like images or fonts.

**Example:**

CSS

```css
h1 {  /* Selector: targets all <h1> elements */
  color: blue;  /* Property: defines the color */
  font-size: 2em;  /* Property: defines the font size */
  text-align: center;  /* Property: defines the text alignment */
}

p {  /* Selector: targets all <p> elements */
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  /* Property: defines the font family */
  line-height: 1.5;  /* Property: defines the line spacing */
}
```

In this example:

- The first block styles all `<h1>` elements to be blue, have a font size twice the default, and be centered horizontally.
- The second block styles all `<p>` elements to use the Arial font or a similar sans-serif font and have a line spacing of 1.5 times the font size.
