2.4 GHz is a radio frequency that is commonly used for a variety of purposes, including:

- **Wi-Fi:** Most Wi-Fi routers use the 2.4 GHz band to transmit data. It is the most widely used Wi-Fi frequency, but it is also the slowest.
    
- **Bluetooth:** Bluetooth devices also use the 2.4 GHz band to communicate with each other.
- **Cordless phones:** Cordless phones use the 2.4 GHz band to transmit signals between the handset and the base station.
- **Microwave ovens:** Microwave ovens use the 2.4 GHz frequency to heat food.
- **Baby monitors:** Some baby monitors use the 2.4 GHz band to transmit audio and video signals.
- **Garage door openers:** Some garage door openers use the 2.4 GHz band to transmit signals between the remote control and the opener.

The 2.4 GHz frequency is a good choice for applications that require a long range, such as Wi-Fi coverage in a large home or office. However, it is also susceptible to interference from other devices that use the same frequency. This can lead to slower speeds and dropped connections.

If you are looking for a faster Wi-Fi connection, you may want to consider using a router that supports the 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz band offers faster speeds, but it has a shorter range than the 2.4 GHz band.
