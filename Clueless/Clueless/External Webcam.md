An external webcam is a camera that connects to a computer via USB and allows you to participate in video conferencing, record videos, and live stream. They are often used to improve the video quality compared to the built-in webcams found on many laptops.

Here are some key benefits of using an external webcam:

- **Improved video quality:** External webcams generally offer higher resolutions and better image quality compared to built-in webcams, resulting in a more professional and clear appearance during video calls or recordings.
- **More features:** Many external webcams come with additional features like autofocus, low-light correction, and built-in microphones, which can enhance your video conferencing experience.
- **Greater flexibility:** External webcams can be easily positioned and adjusted to get the perfect framing and lighting for your videos, unlike fixed built-in webcams.
- **Privacy cover:** Some external webcams come with a privacy cover that you can slide over the lens when not in use, providing an extra layer of security and privacy.

Here are some factors to consider when choosing an external webcam:

- **Resolution:** Higher resolution (e.g., 1080p, 4K) generally translates to sharper and clearer image quality.
- **Frame rate:** Higher frame rates (e.g., 30fps, 60fps) provide smoother video, especially important for video conferencing and live streaming.
- **Field of view:** Wider field of view allows you to capture more of your surroundings in the video.
- **Autofocus:** Autofocus ensures your image stays sharp even if you move around during video calls.
- **Low-light correction:** Improves image quality in low-light conditions.
- **Microphone:** Built-in microphone can be convenient for video calls without needing a separate headset.
- **Compatibility:** Ensure the webcam is compatible with your operating system and computer's USB port.
- **Price:** External webcams range in price depending on their features and quality.

Overall, external webcams can be a valuable addition to your computer setup, especially if you frequently participate in video conferencing, record videos, or live stream. By considering your needs and budget, you can choose an external webcam that enhances your video communication and creation experience.
