**MemTest86** and **MemTest86+** are **memory testing software programs** designed to **thoroughly test and stress test your computer's Random Access Memory (RAM) for errors**. They function by writing various patterns to different memory addresses, reading them back, and comparing the results to identify any discrepancies that might indicate RAM malfunctioning.

Here's a breakdown of **MemTest86 and MemTest86+**:

- **MemTest86:** The original, free, and closed-source software developed by Chris Brady in 1994. It boots from a USB flash drive and offers a basic text-based interface.
- **MemTest86+:** An open-source, free alternative based on MemTest86 but with ongoing development and improvements by the community. It also boots from a USB drive and provides a more user-friendly interface with additional features.

**Key functionalities of MemTest86 and MemTest86+:**

- **Comprehensive memory testing:** Employs various algorithms and test patterns to stress test your RAM and identify potential errors like stuck bits, parity errors, and memory timing issues.
- **Pass/fail results:** Provides clear pass/fail feedback on the overall memory test, indicating whether any errors were detected.
- **Detailed information:** Offers detailed information about the detected errors, including their type, location, and potential causes, aiding in troubleshooting.
- **Multiple test options:** Allows you to customize test parameters, such as the number of passes, memory addresses to test, and test intensity.

**Here's when using MemTest86 or MemTest86+ might be beneficial:**

- **Experiencing system instability:** If you encounter frequent crashes, freezes, or unexpected behavior, RAM errors could be a potential culprit. MemTest86 can help diagnose these issues.
- **Troubleshooting blue screen errors (BSOD):** Blue screens sometimes occur due to RAM problems. Running MemTest86 can help determine if RAM is the root cause.
- **Building or upgrading your PC:** Before relying on newly installed RAM, using MemTest86 to verify its functionality is recommended.
- **Overclocking your RAM:** Pushing RAM beyond its standard specifications (overclocking) can increase its performance but also introduce instability. MemTest86 can help assess stability after overclocking.

**Important considerations:**

- **Running MemTest86 can be time-consuming:** A thorough test can take several hours, depending on the amount of RAM and chosen settings.
- **Requires booting from a USB drive:** You'll need to create a bootable USB drive using the provided utilities to run MemTest86 or MemTest86+.
- **Technical knowledge might be helpful:** While the software is generally user-friendly, interpreting detailed test results and taking appropriate action might require some technical knowledge or guidance.

**In conclusion, MemTest86 and MemTest86+ are valuable tools for diagnosing RAM-related issues in your computer. They offer comprehensive testing capabilities and can be helpful in identifying and troubleshooting memory errors that might lead to system instability or unexpected behavior.**
