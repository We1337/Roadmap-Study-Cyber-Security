Malware removal tools are **software applications designed to detect and remove malicious software (malware)** from your computer system. Malware can encompass various harmful programs like viruses, worms, Trojan horses, spyware, ransomware, and adware. These programs can wreak havoc on your system, stealing data, causing performance issues, and compromising your privacy.

Here's a breakdown of key aspects of malware removal tools:

**Types of Malware Removal Tools:**

- **Anti-malware software:** These tools focus specifically on detecting and removing existing malware infections. While some antivirus software includes anti-malware capabilities, dedicated anti-malware tools may offer deeper scanning and removal functionalities. Examples include **Malwarebytes Free, Hitman Pro, and Zemana AntiMalware Free**.
- **Rootkit removal tools:** These specialized tools target **rootkits**, particularly stealthy malware that can be difficult to detect and remove. Some antivirus and anti-malware programs may include basic rootkit detection, but dedicated rootkit removal tools offer more advanced capabilities.
- **Online scanners:** Some websites offer free online scanning tools that can identify malware on your system. However, these tools typically have limitations in removal capabilities and may not be as comprehensive as dedicated software installations.

- **Restart your system:** After removal, restart your computer to ensure the changes take effect.

**Additional Tips:**
