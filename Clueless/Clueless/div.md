The `<li>` tag in HTML stands for **list item** and is used to define **individual items** within an ordered list (`<ol>`) or an unordered list (`<ul>`).

Here are the key points about the `<li>` tag:

- **Purpose:** It represents a single item in a list.
- **Content:** Anything placed between the opening `<li>` and closing `</li>` tags becomes part of that specific list item. This can include text, images, or even other inline elements.
- **Nesting:** You can't nest `<li>` tags directly within each other. However, you can nest ordered or unordered lists within each other, which indirectly creates nested list items.
- **Behavior:** While the browser might add some default styling, the visual presentation of `<li>` elements is primarily controlled by the parent list (`<ul>` or `<ol>`). Unordered lists typically display list items with bullet points (â€¢), while ordered lists use numbers or letters (1., 2., a., b., etc.).

Here's an example of how the `<li>` tag is used:

HTML

```
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
  <li>Bread</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Brush your teeth.</li>
  <li>Eat breakfast.</li>
  <li>Get dressed.</li>
</ol>
```

This code will create two lists:

- An unordered list with three bullet points for "Coffee," "Milk," and "Bread."
- An ordered list with numbered steps for a morning routine.

Remember, the `<li>` tag itself doesn't determine the visual style of the list item (bullet points, numbers, etc.). That aspect is controlled by the parent list tag (`<ul>` or `<ol>`).
