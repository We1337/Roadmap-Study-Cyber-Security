**JRT (Junk Removal Tool)**, developed by Malwarebytes, was a **free tool** specifically designed to **remove junkware and adware** from your Windows PC. It targeted:

- **Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUPs):** These programs might not be inherently malicious but can negatively impact your system performance or privacy by displaying unwanted ads, collecting data, or modifying browser settings.
- **Adware:** Programs that bombard you with unwanted advertisements.
- **Toolbars and browser hijackers:** These infiltrate your web browser, altering settings, displaying unwanted toolbars, and redirecting searches.

**However, JRT is no longer offered by Malwarebytes.** They officially **discontinued development and support for JRT in October 2017**. This decision was made in favor of focusing their efforts on developing and improving their core antivirus and anti-malware software products.

While JRT was a valuable tool back in the day, its functionality has been **largely integrated into contemporary Malwarebytes solutions**, particularly **Malwarebytes Free** and **Malwarebytes Premium**. These offer:

- **Real-time protection:** Continuously monitors your system for threats, including adware and PUPs.
- **On-demand scanning:** Allows you to initiate manual scans for comprehensive detection and removal of various threats, including those previously targeted by JRT.
- **Additional features:** Depending on the version (Free vs. Premium), you may benefit from functionalities like web protection, ransomware protection, vulnerability scanning, and privacy features, offering broader security coverage beyond JRT's original scope.

If you were previously using JRT, it's recommended to **transition to an alternative solution** like **Malwarebytes Free** or explore other reputable antivirus and anti-malware programs. These provide comprehensive protection and often incorporate functionalities similar to JRT, along with additional features for enhanced security.
