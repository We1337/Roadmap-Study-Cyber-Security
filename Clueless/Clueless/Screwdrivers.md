Screwdrivers are a fundamental tool for any IT support professional's arsenal. They are used for opening computer cases, installing hardware components, and making repairs to various devices.

Here are some of the different types of screwdrivers that are commonly used in IT support:

- **Phillips:** The Phillips screwdriver has a cross-shaped tip that fits into a corresponding recess in the screw head. This type of screwdriver is very common and is used for a wide variety of applications.
    
- **Flathead:** The flathead screwdriver has a flat, tapered blade that fits into a slot in the screw head. Flathead screwdrivers are not as common as Phillips screwdrivers, but they are still essential for certain tasks, such as prying open cases or removing screws with damaged heads.
    
- **Torx:** The Torx screwdriver has a star-shaped tip that provides a tighter fit than a Phillips screwdriver. This can help to prevent the screwdriver from slipping out of the screw head, which can damage the screw. Torx screwdrivers are becoming increasingly common in electronics and other devices.
    
- **Security Torx:** Security Torx screwdrivers have a small pin in the center of the tip that prevents them from being used with standard Torx screws. These screws are often used to deter tampering with sensitive equipment.
    
- **Hex:** Hex screwdrivers, also known as Allen wrenches, have a hexagonal-shaped tip that fits into a hexagonal socket in the screw head. Hex screws are commonly used in furniture, bicycles, and other applications where a strong, tight fit is required.
    

When choosing screwdrivers for IT support, it is important to select a set that includes a variety of tip sizes. You will also want to choose screwdrivers that are made from a high-quality material, such as chrome vanadium steel, which is strong and durable.
