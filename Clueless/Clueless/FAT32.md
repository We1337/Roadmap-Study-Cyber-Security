**What is FAT32 format:**

FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32) is a file system used for storing data on disks. It was widely used in earlier versions of Windows and is still compatible with many devices like USB drives, SD cards, and older computers.

**Pros and Cons of FAT32:**

**Pros:**

- **Widely compatible:** Works on most operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Simple and efficient:** Easier to manage and less resource-intensive than some newer file systems.
- **Suitable for small to medium storage:** Good for storing files and applications up to 4GB in size.

**Cons:**

- **Limited file size:** Maximum file size is 4GB, which can be a limitation for large media files.
- **Less efficient for large storage:** Not ideal for large disks due to potential performance issues.
- **Less secure:** Offers limited security features compared to modern file systems.

**When to use FAT32:**

- Formatting USB drives or SD cards for compatibility with various devices.
- Transferring files between different operating systems.
- Using on older computers with limited storage.

**Formatting a drive to FAT32:**
