Coaxial cable, often shortened to coax, is a type of electrical cable that consists of four main parts:

1. **Inner conductor:** This is the center conductor, typically made of a single solid wire like copper or aluminum. It carries the main signal.
    
2. **Insulator:** This is a dielectric material, such as polyethylene or foam, that surrounds the inner conductor and separates it from the outer conductor. It prevents the signal from leaking out or being corrupted by other electrical signals.
    
3. **Braided shield:** This is a layer of braided metal, typically copper or aluminum, that surrounds the insulator. It acts as a shield to block external electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI) that can corrupt the signal.
    
4. **Outer jacket:** This is the outermost layer, typically made of PVC (polyvinyl chloride) or another protective material. It protects the cable from physical damage and environmental factors.
    

**Here are some key characteristics of coaxial cabling:**

- **Durability:** Coaxial cables are relatively durable and can withstand wear and tear.
- **Shielding:** The braided shield effectively blocks EMI and RFI, ensuring signal integrity.
- **Impedance:** Coaxial cables have a characteristic impedance, which is the resistance to electrical current flow. This impedance needs to be matched between the cable and the devices it connects to avoid signal reflections and distortions.
- **Applications:** Coaxial cables are used in various applications, including:
    - **Television signal transmission:** Traditionally used for transmitting cable television signals from the service provider to homes and businesses.
    - **Satellite dish connections:** Used to connect satellite dishes to receivers for receiving satellite TV signals.
    - **Computer networks:** Used in some older Ethernet networks and certain high-speed data transmission applications.
    - **Radio frequency (RF) applications:** Used for connecting antennas and other RF equipment.

**Compared to twisted-pair cables, coaxial cables generally offer:**

- **Higher bandwidth:** This allows for transmission of higher frequencies and data rates.
- **Better shielding:** The braided shield provides superior protection against EMI and RFI.

However, **coaxial cables also have some drawbacks:**

- **Thicker and less flexible:** They are thicker and less flexible than twisted-pair cables, making them more challenging to install in tight spaces.
- **Higher cost:** They are generally more expensive than twisted-pair cables.

In conclusion, coaxial cabling has played a significant role in various applications, particularly in transmitting television signals and radio frequencies. While its use in some areas has been superseded by newer technologies like fiber optic cables, it remains a relevant and valuable technology in specific applications.
