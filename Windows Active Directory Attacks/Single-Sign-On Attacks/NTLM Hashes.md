NTLM (NT LAN Manager) is an authentication protocol used in Microsoft Windows operating systems to authenticate users and establish secure sessions. NTLM hashes are a representation of user passwords stored in the Active Directory database or SAM (Security Account Manager) database on Windows systems.

When a user sets or changes their password, the system generates an NTLM hash, which is a one-way mathematical transformation of the password. The NTLM hash is stored in the respective database instead of the actual password. During the authentication process, the user's entered password is transformed into an NTLM hash and compared with the stored hash to determine if the authentication is successful.

NTLM hashes are considered weaker compared to more modern and secure password hashing algorithms, such as bcrypt or Argon2, due to several reasons:

1.  Weak Hashing Algorithm: NTLM uses a simple hashing algorithm that is vulnerable to various types of attacks, including brute force, dictionary attacks, and precomputed hash tables (rainbow tables).
2.  No Salt: NTLM hashes do not include a salt, which is an additional random value added to the password before hashing. The absence of a salt makes NTLM hashes more susceptible to precomputed tables or rainbow table attacks.
3.  Limited Hash Length: NTLM hashes are 16 bytes (128 bits) in length, which can make them more vulnerable to brute force or collision attacks compared to longer and more complex hashing algorithms.

Due to these weaknesses, it is generally recommended to migrate to more secure password storage mechanisms, such as using modern hash algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt, which incorporate salting, key stretching, and other security measures to protect against various attack vectors.

It's worth noting that the latest versions of Windows and Active Directory support stronger password hashing algorithms by default, such as Kerberos and the use of the more secure NTLMv2 protocol. These enhancements provide better protection against password attacks and improve the overall security of authentication within Windows environments.
