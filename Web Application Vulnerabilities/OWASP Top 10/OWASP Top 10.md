The OWASP Top 10 is a widely recognized list of the top 10 most critical web application security risks. It is created and maintained by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving software security.

Here is the latest version of the OWASP Top 10 list as of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021. Please note that the list may have been updated since then, so it's always a good idea to check the official OWASP website for the most current version:

1. Injection: This refers to vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject malicious code or commands into an application's data input, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, or LDAP injection.
2. Broken Authentication and Session Management: These vulnerabilities occur when an application's authentication and session management mechanisms are flawed, allowing attackers to compromise user accounts, passwords, or session tokens.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): XSS vulnerabilities enable attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, potentially leading to the theft of sensitive information or session hijacking.
4. XML External Entities (XXE): This risk arises when an application processes XML input without proper validation, leading to the disclosure of internal files, denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF), or remote code execution.
5. Security Misconfiguration: This refers to weaknesses resulting from insecurely configured applications, frameworks, servers, or cloud services, which can provide unauthorized access, information leakage, or other security issues.
6. Sensitive Data Exposure: Inadequate protection of sensitive data, such as credit card numbers, personal identifiable information (PII), or passwords, can lead to unauthorized access, identity theft, or financial loss.
7. Broken Access Control: When access controls are not implemented properly, attackers can exploit the vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to sensitive functionality or data, potentially leading to information disclosure or privilege escalation.
8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF): CSRF vulnerabilities allow attackers to trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions on a web application by exploiting their existing session.
9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities: When applications use outdated or insecure components, such as libraries or frameworks, it opens up opportunities for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access.
10. Insufficient Logging and Monitoring: Lack of proper logging and monitoring mechanisms makes it difficult to detect security incidents or investigate and respond to attacks effectively, potentially delaying breach detection and remediation.

Please note that this list is subject to change as new threats and vulnerabilities emerge. For the most up-to-date information, I recommend visiting the official OWASP website at [https://owasp.org/](https://owasp.org/).
