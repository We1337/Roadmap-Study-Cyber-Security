Spectre is a computer vulnerability that affects modern microprocessors, including those from Intel, AMD, and ARM. It was publicly disclosed in January 2018 along with Meltdown (which we discussed earlier), and it is identified by several CVEs, including CVE-2017-5753 and CVE-2017-5715. Spectre allows an attacker to exploit the speculative execution feature in processors to access sensitive information from memory.

Speculative execution is a technique used by processors to improve performance. It allows the processor to execute instructions ahead of time, even before it is certain that they will be needed. Spectre specifically targets the branch prediction and speculative execution mechanisms to extract sensitive information.

The vulnerability arises from the fact that, during speculative execution, the processor may access data that it should not be able to access under normal circumstances. By carefully crafting malicious code, an attacker can induce the processor to speculatively execute instructions that leak sensitive information. This can include passwords, encryption keys, and other data stored in memory.

Spectre is a complex vulnerability, and it is more difficult to exploit than Meltdown. It affects a broader range of processors and is harder to fully mitigate. Various software and hardware mitigations have been developed to minimize the risk, but complete eradication is challenging.

Operating system and hardware vendors have released patches and updates to mitigate the Spectre vulnerability. These patches include changes to the processor's microcode, as well as updates to operating systems and applications. However, due to the complexity of the vulnerability, mitigations often involve trade-offs between security and performance.

As with other vulnerabilities, staying up to date with the latest security patches and updates is crucial to protect against Spectre and related vulnerabilities. Regularly updating your operating system, firmware, and software applications helps ensure you have the latest protections against known vulnerabilities.

It's worth noting that the information provided here is based on my knowledge up until September 2021, and there may have been further developments or mitigations related to Spectre since then. Therefore, it is essential to stay informed about the latest security advisories and follow best practices recommended by software and hardware vendors.
