A **domain name**, in the realm of the internet, acts as a **human-friendly label** that **identifies a specific website**. It's analogous to a street address in the physical world, guiding users to the desired online location. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of domain names, their functionalities, and key aspects:

**Functionalities:**

- **User-friendliness:** Replaces complex numerical **IP addresses** (e.g., "172.217.160.132") with memorable and easy-to-type names (e.g., "[invalid URL removed]"). This simplifies internet navigation and user experience.
- **Identification:** Uniquely identifies a website on the internet, differentiating it from countless others.
- **Branding:** Domain names often reflect the brand or identity associated with the website, fostering recognition and memorability.
- **Resource location:** Helps users locate specific resources (websites, email servers, etc.) within the vast internet landscape.
