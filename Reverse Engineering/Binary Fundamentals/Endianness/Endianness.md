Endianness refers to the order in which bytes are stored in computer memory. It determines how multibyte data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, and characters that occupy more than one byte, are represented in memory. There are two main types of endianness: big-endian and little-endian.

1. **Big-Endian:**
   - In a big-endian system, the most significant byte (the one with the highest memory address) is stored at the lowest memory address.
   - Subsequent bytes are stored in decreasing order of significance.
   - Big-endian is analogous to how we write decimal numbers, with the most significant digit on the left.

2. **Little-Endian:**
   - In a little-endian system, the least significant byte (the one with the lowest memory address) is stored at the lowest memory address.
   - Subsequent bytes are stored in increasing order of significance.
   - Little-endian is analogous to how we write decimal numbers, with the least significant digit on the left.

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between big-endian and little-endian:

Consider the 32-bit hexadecimal number `0x12345678`.

- **Big-Endian:**
  - In memory: `12 34 56 78`
  - The most significant byte (`12`) is at the lowest memory address.

- **Little-Endian:**
  - In memory: `78 56 34 12`
  - The least significant byte (`78`) is at the lowest memory address.

The choice between big-endian and little-endian is primarily a design decision made by hardware architects and system developers. Different computer architectures and processor families may use different endianness. Some architectures, like x86 and x86-64, are little-endian, while others, like PowerPC and SPARC, can be either big-endian or little-endian depending on configuration.

Endianness becomes relevant when data is transferred between systems with different endianness or when interpreting binary data formats that specify a particular endianness. It's important to be aware of endianness when working with low-level programming, network protocols, file formats, and data serialization. Some protocols and file formats explicitly define the endianness they use to ensure interoperability between systems.
