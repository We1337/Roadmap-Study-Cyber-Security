A box of Cat5e cable typically contains a long, single strand of cable, often hundreds of feet long. This cable is not ready for use as it doesn't have connectors on the ends. These cables are meant to be cut to the desired length and then crimped with RJ45 connectors on each end to create ethernet cables.

Here are some things to keep in mind when buying a box of Cat5e cable:

- **Length:** Boxes of Cat5e cable typically come in lengths ranging from 100 feet to 1000 feet. Choose the length that is best for your needs.
- **Wire gauge:** The lower the gauge number, the thicker the wire. Thicker wires are generally more durable and can handle longer cable runs. However, they are also more expensive. 24 AWG is a common wire gauge for Cat5e cable.
- **Shielding:** Shielded Cat5e cable (STP) is less susceptible to interference than unshielded Cat5e cable (UTP). However, it is also more expensive and difficult to work with. UTP is the most common type of Cat5e cable.
