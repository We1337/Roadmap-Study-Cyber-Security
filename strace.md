The `strace` command is a powerful diagnostic tool in Unix-like operating systems that is used to trace system calls and signals between a process and the kernel. It allows you to monitor the interactions of a program with the operating system, providing insights into its behavior, system calls, and resource usage.

Here's a basic usage example:

```bash
strace <command>
```

Replace `<command>` with the command you want to trace. For example:

```bash
strace ls -l
```

This command will execute the `ls -l` command and print a detailed trace of system calls made by the `ls` program.

Some common options for the `strace` command include:

- `-c`: This option counts the number of calls, time, and errors for each system call and reports a summary at the end.
  
  ```bash
  strace -c ls -l
  ```

- `-f`: This option follows child processes as they are created, providing a trace of the entire process tree.

  ```bash
  strace -f ./my_program
  ```

- `-o <output-file>`: This option redirects the output to a file instead of printing it to the console.

  ```bash
  strace -o output.txt ls -l
  ```

- `-p <pid>`: This option attaches to an existing process specified by its process ID.

  ```bash
  strace -p 1234
  ```

`strace` can be a valuable tool for debugging, performance analysis, and understanding how a program interacts with the underlying system. It provides detailed information about system calls, signals, and errors, aiding in the identification of issues or bottlenecks in the program's execution.
