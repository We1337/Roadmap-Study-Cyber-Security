SQLite is a popular open-source embedded relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in applications where a lightweight, file-based database is required. Here are some key concepts related to SQLite:

1. File-based database: SQLite databases are file-based, meaning that the entire database is contained within a single file. This makes it easy to distribute and deploy the database as part of an application.
2. SQL: SQLite uses SQL (Structured Query Language) as its primary query language. SQL allows users to create, modify, and query tables and their data.
3. Tables: Tables are the basic building blocks of SQLite databases. Each table consists of rows and columns, with each column representing a different data field, and each row representing a unique record.
4. Primary key: A primary key is a column or combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. This is used to ensure that each row in the table is unique and can be referenced by other tables as a foreign key.
5. Foreign key: A foreign key is a column or combination of columns that references a primary key in another table. This is used to establish relationships between tables.
6. Indexes: Indexes are used to speed up data retrieval by creating a data structure that allows data to be retrieved more efficiently. SQLite supports several types of indexes, including primary keys, unique keys, and non-unique keys.
7. Transactions: Transactions are used to ensure that database operations are executed as a single, atomic unit of work. This helps to maintain data consistency and integrity.
8. Views: Views are virtual tables that are based on the result of a SELECT statement. Views can be used to simplify complex queries, or to restrict access to certain data.
9. Backup and recovery: SQLite provides tools for backup and recovery of data in the event of errors, failures, or disasters.
10. Cross-platform: SQLite is a cross-platform database, meaning that it can be used on a wide variety of operating systems and platforms.

SQLite is a lightweight and flexible RDBMS that is well-suited for many types of applications, including mobile apps, desktop applications, and embedded systems. Understanding these key concepts is essential for working with SQLite and developing applications that use SQLite databases.
