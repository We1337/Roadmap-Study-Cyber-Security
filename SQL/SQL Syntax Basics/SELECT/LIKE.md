The LIKE operator in SQL is used in conjunction with the WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column. It is particularly useful when you want to retrieve data that matches a certain pattern rather than an exact value. The basic syntax of the LIKE operator is as follows:

```
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
```

Here, `column1`, `column2`, and so on represent the names of the columns that you want to retrieve from the specified `table_name`. The `column_name` specifies the column in which you want to search for the pattern. The `pattern` is the string or expression that you want to match against the values in the specified column. The pattern can include wildcards that represent any character or set of characters.

There are two main types of wildcards that can be used with the LIKE operator:

-   `%`: matches any sequence of zero or more characters
-   `_`: matches any single character

For example, the following SQL statement selects all rows from the `customers` table where the `name` column starts with the letter "J":

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE name LIKE 'J%';
```

This statement will return all rows from the `customers` table where the `name` column starts with the letter "J". Note that the `%` wildcard represents any sequence of zero or more characters that follow the "J" character.

You can also use the `%` wildcard at the beginning and end of the pattern to match any sequence of characters before or after the specified string. For example, the following SQL statement selects all rows from the `customers` table where the `email` column contains the domain "example.com":

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE email LIKE '%@example.com';
```

This statement will return all rows from the `customers` table where the `email` column ends with the domain "@example.com". Note that the `%` wildcard is used at the beginning of the pattern to match any sequence of characters before the "@" symbol.
