The WHERE clause is used in SQL to filter data based on a specified condition. It allows you to select rows from a table that meet a particular set of criteria. The basic syntax of the WHERE clause is as follows:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

Here, `column1`, `column2`, and so on represent the names of the columns that you want to retrieve from the specified `table_name`. The `condition` specifies the criteria that must be met for a row to be included in the result set. The WHERE clause can be used with various comparison operators to create the condition.

Here are some common comparison operators used in the WHERE clause:

-   `=`: equal to
-   `<>` or `!=`: not equal to
-   `<`: less than
-   `>`: greater than
-   `<=`: less than or equal to
-   `>=`: greater than or equal to

You can also use logical operators, such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, to combine multiple conditions in the WHERE clause.

For example, the following SQL statement selects all rows from the `customers` table where the `country` is "USA" and the `age` is greater than or equal to 18:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country = 'USA' AND age >= 18;
```

This statement will return all rows from the `customers` table that match the specified conditions.

The WHERE clause can be used with other SQL statements as well, such as UPDATE and DELETE, to update or delete specific rows from a table based on certain conditions.
