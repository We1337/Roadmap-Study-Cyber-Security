`airmon-ng` is a command-line utility in the Aircrack-ng suite, which is a set of tools for auditing wireless networks. `airmon-ng` is specifically designed to manage wireless network interfaces, including putting them into monitor mode. Monitor mode is essential for wireless security testing and packet sniffing because it allows the wireless card to capture all wireless frames, not just those addressed to a specific network.

Here are some common commands and features associated with `airmon-ng`:

1. **Viewing Available Wireless Interfaces:**
   ```bash
   airmon-ng
   ```
   This command displays a list of available wireless interfaces on your system.

2. **Putting a Wireless Interface into Monitor Mode:**
   ```bash
   airmon-ng start <interface>
   ```
   Replace `<interface>` with the name of your wireless interface. This command puts the specified wireless interface into monitor mode. For example:
   ```bash
   airmon-ng start wlan0
   ```

3. **Stopping Monitor Mode:**
   ```bash
   airmon-ng stop <mon0>
   ```
   If you put an interface into monitor mode, you can use this command to stop monitor mode. Replace `<mon0>` with the monX interface created by `airmon-ng start`. For example:
   ```bash
   airmon-ng stop mon0
   ```

4. **Checking Processes that Might Interfere:**
   ```bash
   airmon-ng check
   ```
   This command checks for processes that might interfere with the proper operation of Aircrack-ng tools and suggests how to handle them.

5. **Killing Processes that Interfere:**
   ```bash
   airmon-ng check kill
   ```
   This command kills processes that may interfere with Aircrack-ng tools.

Remember, the usage of Aircrack-ng tools, including `airmon-ng`, should always be in compliance with legal and ethical standards. Unauthorized access to networks or systems is illegal, and you should only use these tools on networks and systems for which you have explicit permission. Ethical and responsible use of security tools is paramount.
