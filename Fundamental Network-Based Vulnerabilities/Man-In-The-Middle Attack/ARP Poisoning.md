ARP poisoning, also known as ARP spoofing or ARP cache poisoning, is a technique used in network attacks to manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) tables on a local area network (LAN). It involves sending malicious ARP messages to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device on the network, such as the default gateway or a specific target.

Here's how ARP poisoning typically works:

1.  **ARP Protocol**: The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used in Ethernet networks to map an IP address to a MAC address. Devices on a LAN use ARP to determine the MAC address associated with a particular IP address.
2.  **ARP Table**: Each device maintains an ARP table, also known as an ARP cache, which stores the IP-to-MAC address mappings of other devices on the network.
3.  **Attacker's Action**: The attacker on the same local network initiates ARP poisoning by sending forged ARP messages. These messages contain fake IP-to-MAC address mappings, associating the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another device.
4.  **ARP Cache Poisoning**: The target device or the default gateway receives the forged ARP messages and updates its ARP table with the fake IP-to-MAC mapping provided by the attacker.
5.  **Redirected Traffic**: Now, when any traffic is sent to the target device or the default gateway, it is mistakenly sent to the attacker's MAC address instead. This enables the attacker to intercept, monitor, modify, or block the network traffic as desired.

ARP poisoning can be used for various malicious purposes, including:

a. **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks**: By intercepting network traffic, the attacker can eavesdrop on communication, capture sensitive information, and perform other types of attacks like session hijacking or credential theft.

b. **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The attacker can flood the network with forged ARP messages, causing confusion and disruptions by flooding devices with incorrect ARP mappings or causing them to continuously update their ARP tables.

c. **Network Sniffing**: Once the attacker has redirected network traffic, they can capture and analyze the data packets passing through the compromised network, potentially revealing sensitive information.

d. **Session Hijacking**: By intercepting and tampering with network traffic, the attacker can hijack established sessions, impersonate users, and gain unauthorized access to systems or applications.

To protect against ARP poisoning attacks, several measures can be implemented:

1.  **Static ARP Entries**: Manually configure static ARP entries on critical devices to prevent their ARP tables from being manipulated. This requires knowing and specifying the correct IP-to-MAC address mappings.
2.  **ARP Spoofing Detection**: Implement network monitoring tools or intrusion detection systems that can detect and alert when ARP spoofing attacks occur. These tools can identify inconsistencies in ARP traffic and detect suspicious ARP activity.
3.  **ARP Spoofing Prevention**: Enable features like port security or dynamic ARP inspection on network switches to mitigate ARP spoofing attacks. These features can block or restrict the impact of malicious ARP traffic.
4.  **Network Segmentation**: Divide the network into separate subnets or VLANs, using routers or firewalls to control the flow of traffic between them. This can limit the scope of ARP poisoning attacks and prevent attackers from accessing critical segments of the network.
5.  **Encryption and Authentication**: Implement secure protocols like IPsec or SSL/TLS to encrypt network traffic and ensure that communication channels are authenticated, preventing attackers from tampering with or intercepting sensitive data.

ARP poisoning is a serious security concern, particularly in LAN environments. By implementing appropriate security measures and regularly monitoring network activity, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of successful ARP poisoning attacks.
