Hexadecimal, often referred to as base 16, is a numeral system that uses 16 unique digits to represent numbers. In addition to the decimal digits 0 to 9, hexadecimal introduces six additional symbols: A, B, C, D, E, and F. Here's an overview of hexadecimal:

Hexadecimal (Base 16):
- Uses 16 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, and F.
- Each digit represents a value that is a power of 16.
- The rightmost digit represents the ones place, the next digit to the left represents the sixteens place (16^1), the next digit represents the 256s place (16^2), and so on.
- The letters A to F represent the decimal values 10 to 15, respectively.
- For example, the hexadecimal number 2F is calculated as (2 * 16^1) + (15 * 16^0) = 32 + 15 = 47 in decimal.

Hexadecimal is widely used in various computing applications, such as:
- Memory addressing and representation of binary data.
- Encoding and decoding of binary values for easier comprehension.
- Color representation, where each component (red, green, blue) is often represented by two hexadecimal digits, allowing for a wide range of colors to be expressed.

When converting between hexadecimal and decimal, each hexadecimal digit can be substituted with its corresponding decimal value and then calculated as a base 10 number.

Comparison with Base 10:
- Base 10 (decimal) uses ten digits (0-9), while base 16 (hexadecimal) uses sixteen digits (0-9, A-F).
- Hexadecimal provides a more compact representation of large binary numbers compared to decimal.
- Hexadecimal is commonly used in computing due to its direct relationship with binary, as each hexadecimal digit represents four binary digits (bits).
- Hexadecimal numbers are often denoted by the prefix "0x" (e.g., 0x2F) to distinguish them from decimal numbers.

In summary, hexadecimal is a base 16 numeral system that uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F. It is commonly used in computing and provides a convenient way to represent and work with binary data.
