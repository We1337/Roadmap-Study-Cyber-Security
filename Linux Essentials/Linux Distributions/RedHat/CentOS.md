CentOS (Community Enterprise Operating System) is a Linux distribution that is built from the same source code as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). CentOS aims to provide a free and open-source alternative to RHEL by creating a community-driven, stable, and reliable operating system.

Here are some key aspects and features of CentOS:

1. Relationship with RHEL: CentOS is directly derived from the source code of RHEL. It undergoes a process called recompilation, where the RHEL code is rebuilt and rebranded as CentOS. As a result, CentOS shares many similarities with RHEL in terms of functionality, compatibility, and performance.
2. Free and Open Source: CentOS is freely available to download, use, and distribute. It is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL), which ensures that users have the freedom to modify, study, and distribute the software. This makes CentOS a popular choice for individuals and organizations seeking a stable and community-supported Linux distribution without the cost associated with RHEL.
3. Stability and Reliability: CentOS focuses on providing a stable and reliable operating system for server and enterprise environments. It prioritizes security updates, bug fixes, and compatibility with enterprise software. CentOS releases are known for their long-term support and maintenance, with updates and security patches being provided for a significant duration.
4. Compatibility with RHEL: Due to its close relationship with RHEL, CentOS is highly compatible with RHEL software. Applications and packages developed and tested on RHEL can usually be run seamlessly on CentOS, making it a suitable choice for organizations that rely on RHEL-based software ecosystems.
5. Community and Support: CentOS benefits from an active and supportive community of users and developers. The CentOS community provides resources such as forums, documentation, and user-driven support channels where users can seek assistance, share knowledge, and collaborate with others.
6. CentOS Stream: Starting from CentOS 8, the CentOS project introduced CentOS Stream. CentOS Stream is a rolling-release distribution that sits between Fedora (the upstream development distribution) and RHEL. It offers a more up-to-date and bleeding-edge experience compared to traditional CentOS releases, making it suitable for users who want to be involved in the development and testing process of RHEL.

CentOS has gained popularity as a reliable and community-supported alternative to RHEL, particularly for servers and enterprise deployments. However, it's worth noting that in December 2020, Red Hat announced a shift in the CentOS project, with CentOS 8 transitioning to a downstream build of RHEL rather than a direct rebuild. As a result, CentOS 8 will reach end-of-life at the end of 2021, and CentOS Stream will become the primary focus for future CentOS development and updates.
